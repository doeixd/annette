A good summary should explain what the library is, what it does, its core concepts, how to use it (briefly), and its potential benefits or target use cases.\n\n2.  **Initial Scan \u0026 Identify Core Concepts:**\n    *   Look at the `README.md`. This is the primary source of information about the library\u0027s purpose and usage.\n    *   The title is \"Annette\" and the description says it\u0027s a JavaScript library based on \"interaction nets\". This is the central concept.\n    *   The README mentions modeling algebraic effects, state machines, UI state management, network synchronization, or just entertainment. These are the *applications*.\n    *   Core components mentioned: `Network`, `Agent`, `Connection`, `Rule`, `reduce()`. These are the key building blocks.\n    *   The examples (Counter, Toggle, State Machine, Synchronization) illustrate how these components work together.\n    *   The \"Why Annette?\" section lists benefits: Expressiveness, Flexibility, Modularity, Performance (reduction), Intuitiveness (over time), Scalability, No Traditional Garbage Collection.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Code Structure:**\n    *   `src/`: Contains the core implementation. Filenames like `agent.ts`, `connection.ts`, `network.ts`, `port.ts`, `rule.ts` confirm the core concepts identified in the README.\n    *   `examples/`: Contains usage examples (like `simple.ts`).\n    *   `test/`: Contains tests.\n    *   `assets/papers/`: Contains documents (`convo.md`, `programming-with-interaction-nets.md`). These likely provide theoretical background or design inspiration. *Self-correction: While interesting, delving deep into these papers might be too much for a summary. Focus on what the library *does* based on the code and README.*\n    *   `package.json`: Confirms it\u0027s an `npm` package, lists dependencies (`pridepack`, `vitest`, `typescript`), scripts (`build`, `test`), and metadata (author, license). Description: \"An interaction net based js framework\".\n    *   `LICENSE`: MIT License.\n    *   `tsconfig.json`, `pridepack.json`: Build configuration details.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Core Mechanics:**\n    *   **Interaction Nets:** The foundation. Computation happens through local interactions between connected nodes (Agents).\n    *   **Network:** The runtime container. It holds Agents and Rules and manages the execution (`reduce()`).\n    *   **Agent:** Represents a node in the net. Has a `name`, a `value`, and `ports`. Ports are connection points. There\u0027s a notion of a \"main\" port for default connections.\n    *   **Port:** Connection points on an Agent. They have names and types (main/aux). Connections link ports.\n    *   **Connection:** Represents a link between two ports of two Agents. A connection itself can trigger rules.\n    *   **Rule:** Defines what happens when specific Agents (or more precisely, their ports) are connected. The rule\u0027s `action` function is executed. This action can modify agent values or return new/modified agents/connections to the network. If agents aren\u0027t returned, they might be \"consumed\" or cleaned up (implied by the README counter example and the \"No Traditional Garbage Collection\" point).\n    *   **Reduction (`reduce()`):** The process of finding connected agents that match a rule and executing that rule\u0027s action. This process repeats until no more rules can be applied (reaching a \"normal form\").\n\n5.  **Draft the Summary - First Pass (Mental or rough notes):**\n    *   It\u0027s a JS library for interaction nets.\n    *   You create a Network.\n    *   You define Agents (nodes with state/value and ports).\n    *   You connect Agents via their ports.\n    *   You define Rules for what happens when specific Agents are connected.\n    *   You call `network.reduce()` to run the rules and update the state.\n    *   Can be used for state machines, effects, UI, sync.\n    *   Benefits: declarative, flexible, modular, efficient reduction, no GC.\n\n6.  **Refine and Structure the Summary:** Organize the points logically.\n\n    *   **Introduction:** What is it? (JS library, based on interaction nets). What\u0027s its purpose? (Model systems via agent interactions).\n    *   **Core Concepts:** Explain the key building blocks identified in step 4 (`Network`, `Agent`, `Port`, `Connection`, `Rule`, `reduce`). Briefly describe the role of each.\n    *   **How it Works:** Describe the flow: Define agents/rules -\u003e connect agents -\u003e run `reduce()` -\u003e rules trigger actions -\u003e state changes. Mention the \"local interaction\" and \"reduction\" ideas.\n    *   **Use Cases/Applications:** List the examples from the README (state machines, effects, UI, sync).\n    *   **Key Features/Benefits:** Summarize the points from the \"Why Annette?\" section (Expressiveness, Flexibility, Modularity, Performance/Reduction, GC characteristic).\n    *   **Target Audience (Implied):** Developers interested in alternative computation models, declarative state management, or systems where local interactions define global behavior.\n\n7.  **Add Detail and Polish:**\n    *   Use clearer language. Instead of just \"nodes\", use \"Agents (nodes)\".\n    *   Emphasize the *declarative* nature mentioned in the README.\n    *   Mention the specific TypeScript implementation.\n    *   Ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the provided information.\n    *   Check against the initial goal â€“ does it summarize the library effectively?\n\n8.  **Final Review:** Read through the summary. Does it capture the essence of Annette? Is it concise and understandable? Does it align with the README and code structure? (Yes, it seems to cover the main points well).",

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s summarize the `annette` library based on the provided files.\n\n**Annette: A JavaScript Library for Interaction Nets**\n\nAnnette is a JavaScript/TypeScript library implementing the **interaction nets** computation model. Instead of traditional function calls or message passing, computation progresses through local **interactions** between connected **agents** (nodes) within a **network**.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Network:** The main container and runtime environment. It holds agents, connections, and rules, and orchestrates the computation process via its `reduce()` method.\n2.  **Agent:** Represents a node in the interaction net. Each agent has a `name`, a `value` (state), and `ports`. Agents are the fundamental units of data and computation.\n3.  **Port:** Connection points on an Agent. They have names and types (e.g., `main`, `aux`). Agents connect to each other via their ports. Each agent typically has one `main` port used for default connections.\n4.  **Connection:** Represents a link between two ports on two (potentially the same) agents. Connections are established within the network.\n5.  **Rule:** Defines the behavior when two specific agents are connected (typically via their main ports). A rule specifies an `action` (a function) to execute upon interaction. This action can modify the connected agents\u0027 values or return new agents/connections to replace the interacting ones.\n6.  **Reduction (`network.reduce()`):** The core computational step. The network identifies active connections that match defined rules and executes their actions. This process consumes the interacting agents/connections and potentially produces new ones, repeating until no more rules can be applied (reaching a stable state or \"normal form\").\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  Define a `Network`.\n2.  Create `Agent` instances with initial values.\n3.  `connect` agents within the network, establishing links between their ports.\n4.  Define `Rule`s specifying what should happen when certain types of agents are connected.\n5.  Call `network.reduce()` to trigger the interactions based on the defined rules, evolving the state of the network.\n\n**Key Features \u0026 Benefits (from README):**\n\n*   **Declarative:** Define system behavior through agents and interaction rules rather than imperative steps.\n*   **Flexible:** Applicable to various problems like state machines, algebraic effects, UI state management, and synchronization.\n*   **Modular:** Rules encapsulate interaction logic, promoting composability.\n*   **Efficient Reduction:** Computation happens via local rewrites/reductions.\n*   **Implicit Resource Management:** Interacting agents are consumed and replaced, naturally handling cleanup without traditional garbage collection for the net\u0027s structure itself.\n*   **Parallelism Potential:** Interactions are inherently local, suggesting potential for parallel execution (though the current implementation might be single-threaded).\n\n**Use Cases (Examples Provided):**\n\n*   Simple counters\n*   Toggles\n*   State machines\n*   Basic synchronization logic\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   Written in TypeScript.\n*   Uses `pridepack` for building and `vitest` for testing.\n*   Provides type definitions for core concepts (`IAgent`, `IConnection`, `IRule`, etc.).\n\nIn essence, Annette offers a different paradigm for modeling and computation based on the principles of interaction nets, focusing on local interactions between stateful agents to drive overall system behavior.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process that could lead to the comparison between Interaction Networks and Reactive Signal DAGs:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to explore the similarities and differences between Interaction Network graphs (specifically, the ones Annette implements) and the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) used in reactive signal libraries (like SolidJS, MobX, Preact Signals, etc.). Key points to cover: shared features, differences, conceptual overlaps, and distinctions.\n\n2.  **Define Interaction Networks (Annette\u0027s perspective):**\n    *   **Core Elements:** Agents (nodes), Ports (connection points), Connections (edges), Rules (interaction logic).\n    *   **Computation:** Driven by `reduce()`. Connections matching rules trigger actions. Actions consume interacting agents/connections and can produce new ones. It\u0027s a *graph rewriting* system.\n    *   **State:** Held within Agents (`value` property). Rules *mutate* this state or replace agents entirely.\n    *   **Flow:** Computation propagates through interactions. It\u0027s not necessarily directional in the same way as signals; interactions are local events.\n    *   **Structure:** A general graph, potentially cyclic (though cycles might lead to non-terminating reductions depending on rules).\n    *   **Goal:** Model computation, state evolution, synchronization through local interactions.\n\n3.  **Define Reactive Signal DAGs:**\n    *   **Core Elements:** Signals/Observables (nodes holding state), Computed/Effects (nodes deriving state or performing side effects), Dependencies (edges).\n    *   **Computation:** Driven by changes to signals. When a signal updates, dependent computed signals recalculate, and effects re-run. It\u0027s a *dataflow* system based on dependency tracking.\n    *   **State:** Held within Signals/Observables. Computed nodes derive state *immutably* (conceptually, they return a new value). Effects react to state changes.\n    *   **Flow:** Directional. Changes flow *downstream* from source signals to dependent computations and effects. Explicitly *acyclic* (DAG).\n    *   **Structure:** Directed Acyclic Graph. Cycles are usually errors or handled with specific mechanisms (like deferred updates).\n    *   **Goal:** Efficiently manage and propagate state changes, typically for UI updates or reactive programming patterns.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Similarities (Initial Brainstorm):**\n    *   Both use graphs to represent relationships.\n    *   Both involve nodes holding some form of state/value.\n    *   Both represent computation or state propagation.\n    *   Changes in one part can affect other parts.\n    *   Both aim for some kind of efficiency (local interactions vs. precise dependency tracking).\n    *   Both can model stateful systems.\n\n5.  **Refine Similarities (Connecting Concepts):**\n    *   **Graph Structure:** Both use nodes (Agents/Signals) and edges (Connections/Dependencies) to model relationships and flow.\n    *   **State Representation:** Agents hold `value`; Signals hold values. These are the core state containers.\n    *   **Propagation/Computation:** Interaction rules define how state changes or computation occurs locally based on connections; Signal dependencies define how changes propagate and trigger computations/effects. Both are forms of propagating influence through the graph.\n    *   **Locality:** Interactions in Annette are local; Signal updates trigger only *direct* dependents initially, propagating locally.\n    *   **Reactivity (Broad Sense):** Both systems *react* to conditions. Annette reacts to specific connections matching rules; Signals react to value changes.\n\n6.  **Identify Key Differences (Initial Brainstorm):**\n    *   DAG vs. General Graph (Cycles).\n    *   Dataflow vs. Graph Rewriting.\n    *   Mutation/Replacement vs. Immutable Derivation/Side Effects.\n    *   Triggering mechanism (Rule matching vs. Value change).\n    *   Directionality (Potentially bidirectional/local vs. Strictly downstream).\n    *   Primary Use Case (General computation modeling vs. State management/UI).\n    *   Resource Management (Implicit in rewriting vs. Garbage Collection/Manual Cleanup for signals/effects).\n\n7.  **Refine Differences (Contrasting Concepts):**\n    *   **Graph Topology:** Signals *require* a DAG to guarantee termination and predictable flow. Interaction Nets *can* be general graphs; cycles are possible and their meaning depends on the rules.\n    *   **Computational Model:** Signals are fundamentally *dataflow* â€“ calculating new values based on inputs. Interaction Nets are *graph rewriting* â€“ transforming the graph structure itself based on local patterns.\n    *   **State Update Mechanism:** Signals typically trigger re-computation that produces *new* values for derived states. Effects run side-effects. Annette rules often *mutate* agent state directly (`number.value +\u003d increment.value`) or replace agents entirely.\n    *   **Flow Direction:** Signal flow is strictly *downstream* along dependency edges. Interaction Net \"flow\" is based on where reducible connections (active pairs) exist; it doesn\u0027t have the same inherent directionality. An interaction can create connections that lead \"backward\" or in complex ways.\n    *   **Trigger:** Signals trigger on *value change*. Annette triggers when specific agent *pairs* are connected (structural pattern matching).\n    *   **Resource Management:** Annette\u0027s model has implicit cleanup via agent consumption in rules. Signal systems rely on runtime garbage collection for unused signal nodes and often require manual cleanup for effects/subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.\n    *   **Granularity:** Signal systems often track dependencies finely. Annette\u0027s interactions are based on agent pairs connected at specific ports.\n\n8.  **Synthesize and Structure:** Organize the points into a clear comparison.\n    *   Start with a high-level statement about both being graph-based state/computation models.\n    *   Create a \"Shared Concepts / Similarities\" section. Use comparative language (e.g., \"Both use...\", \"Analogous to...\").\n    *   Create a \"Key Differences\" section. Use contrasting language (e.g., \"Whereas...\", \"In contrast...\", \"Crucially...\"). Focus on the most impactful distinctions (DAG vs. Graph, Dataflow vs. Rewriting, Trigger mechanism).\n    *   Discuss the \"Conceptual Overlap\": Where do the ideas meet? Both model reactive systems where local changes cause wider effects.\n    *   Add a \"Summary Table\" (optional but helpful) to quickly compare key aspects.\n    *   Conclude with a summary statement reinforcing the core distinction: Signals are primarily for managing dataflow dependencies, while Interaction Nets are a more general graph rewriting model for computation.\n\n9.  **Review and Refine:** Read through the comparison. Is it clear? Accurate? Does it directly address the user\u0027s prompt? Ensure the terminology is consistent (Agents vs. Signals, Connections vs. Dependencies, Rules vs. Computations/Effects). Make sure the Annette perspective reflects the provided library code (e.g., mutation within rules). Ensure the Signal perspective is general enough to cover common libraries. *Self-correction: Initially, I might have overemphasized the potential parallelism of INs. While true conceptually, the current library might not exploit it, so temper that claim slightly.* Ensure the difference between *value change* triggering vs. *structural connection* triggering is highlighted.",

Dependencies form the directed edges.\n2.  **Nodes Hold State/Value:**\n    *   **Annette:** Agents explicitly hold a `value`.\n    *   **Signals:** Signal nodes hold a primitive value or object reference. Computed nodes derive their value.\n3.  **Propagation of Change/Computation:** Both models propagate effects through the graph.\n    *   **Annette:** An interaction (rule firing) between two agents can change their state or replace them with new agents/connections, potentially enabling further interactions elsewhere. Computation propagates via these local rewrites.\n    *   **Signals:** A change in a source signal triggers re-computation in dependent nodes downstream. Changes propagate along dependency edges.\n4.  **Reactivity (in a broad sense):** Both systems react to certain conditions.\n    *   **Annette:** Reacts to the *structural* condition of specific agents being connected via specific ports, triggering a rule.\n    *   **Signals:** Reacts to a *value change* in a dependency, triggering re-computation or side effects.\n5.  **Locality of Computation:** Computation is often localized initially.\n    *   **Annette:** An interaction rule only involves the two connected agents and produces local changes (though these can cascade).\n    *   **Signals:** An update triggers computation only in direct dependents first, which then propagates further.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n1.  **Graph Topology (General Graph vs. DAG):**\n    *   **Annette:** Represents a general **graph**. Connections can theoretically form cycles. The meaning and termination behavior of cycles depend entirely on the defined interaction rules. The `connect` operation itself doesn\u0027t prevent cycles.\n    *   **Signals:** Fundamentally relies on a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. This acyclic nature is crucial for guaranteeing termination of updates and predictable data flow. Signal libraries actively prevent or detect cycles, as they usually represent errors in logic.\n2.  **Nature of Computation (Graph Rewriting vs. Dataflow):**\n    *   **Annette:** Is a **graph rewriting** system. Interactions *consume* the participating agents/connections and *replace* them with the results of the rule (which might be modified agents, new agents, or direct connections between previously unconnected ports). The graph structure itself evolves dynamically based on rules.\n    *   **Signals:** Is a **dataflow** system. Nodes typically represent values, and edges represent dependencies for calculation. When a source changes, data *flows* downstream, triggering recalculations that produce *new values* for derived nodes, but the graph structure usually remains static (unless dynamically adding/removing signals/effects).\n3.  **Trigger Mechanism:**\n    *   **Annette:** Triggered by the **structure** â€“ specific pairs of agents being connected via their principal ports matching a defined `Rule`.\n    *   **Signals:** Triggered by **value change** â€“ a signal node\u0027s value being updated.\n4.  **Directionality:**\n    *   **Annette:** Interactions are fundamentally bidirectional or local between two connected ports. While a rule might *conceptually* pass data one way, the connection itself isn\u0027t inherently directional in the same way dependency tracking is. An interaction can create new connections anywhere.\n    *   **Signals:** Flow is strictly **unidirectional** (downstream) along dependency edges.\n5.  **State Management:**\n    *   **Annette:** Rules can directly **mutate** the `value` property of agents involved (e.g., `number.value +\u003d increment.value`) or replace them entirely. State change is part of the graph rewrite.\n    *   **Signals:** Source signals are mutated, but computed signals typically produce *new* values based on their dependencies (promoting immutability in derived state). Effects are explicitly for side effects (like mutation or IO) triggered by changes.\n6.  **Resource Management:**\n    *   **Annette:** The interaction net model has inherent resource management. When agents interact, they are consumed. If a rule doesn\u0027t return an agent, it\u0027s effectively removed from the active graph. This avoids traditional GC *for the net structure*.\n    *   **Signals:** Relies on the host language\u0027s garbage collector for signal/computed nodes. Crucially, *effects* or *subscriptions* often require manual cleanup to avoid memory leaks when they are no longer needed.\n\n**Conceptual Overlap \u0026 Analogy:**\n\nYou *could* think of an Annette `Agent` as somewhat analogous to a reactive `Signal` in that it holds state. A `Rule` is like a specialized, localized computation or effect that only triggers when specific \"signals\" (Agents) are \"connected\" in a particular way, rather than when their value changes. The `network.reduce()` call is analogous to the reactive runtime scheduler that processes pending updates or effects.\n\nHowever, the core mechanism is different: Annette transforms the graph structure based on local interaction patterns, while signals propagate value changes through a static dependency graph.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Feature             | Annette (Interaction Nets)                 | Reactive Signals (DAG)                     |\n| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n| **Graph Type**      | General Graph (Cycles possible)            | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)               |\n| **Computation**     | Graph Rewriting                            | Dataflow                                   |\n| **Trigger**         | Structural Connection + Rule Match         | Value Change in Dependency                 |\n| **Flow**            | Local Interaction (not inherently directed)| Unidirectional (Downstream)                |\n| **State Update**    | Mutation or Agent Replacement via Rules    | Mutation (Sources), Derivation (Computed)  |\n| **Resource Mgmt**   | Implicit via Agent Consumption             | Runtime GC + Manual Cleanup (Effects)      |\n| **Primary Use**     | Computation Modeling, State Machines, Sync | State Management, UI Updates, Data Binding |\n\nIn conclusion, while both use graphs to manage state and computation propagation, they operate on fundamentally different principles. Signal DAGs are optimized for efficient, unidirectional dataflow based on value changes within a fixed (or carefully managed) acyclic structure. Interaction Nets offer a more general graph rewriting model where computation is driven by local structural patterns (connections) and can dynamically alter the graph itself.",

This means representing signals, computations (memos/derived signals), and effects using Agents, Connections, and Rules.\n\n2.  **Identify SolidJS Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Signals (`createSignal`):** Basic units of state. Have a getter and a setter. Reading subscribes the current computation context. Setting notifies dependents.\n    *   **Computations/Memos (`createMemo`):** Derived state. Depend on other signals/memos. Recompute *only* when dependencies change. Cache the result. Reading subscribes the current context.\n    *   **Effects (`createEffect`):** Side effects. Depend on signals/memos. Run *after* changes, executing side effects (DOM updates, logging, etc.). Reading subscribes the effect.\n    *   **Dependency Tracking:** The \"magic\" that links signals to computations/effects. When a signal is read *within* a computation/effect context, a dependency is automatically established.\n    *   **Update Propagation:** When a signal is set, only its direct dependents (computations/effects) are notified and potentially re-run/re-computed.\n\n3.  **Map SolidJS Concepts to Annette Concepts:** How can Agents, Ports, Connections, and Rules represent these?\n    *   **Signals:** Need an Agent to hold the value. How does setting/getting work?\n        *   *Getting:* Reading a signal needs to establish a dependency. How can an Agent signal \"I was read\"? Maybe a connection is made?\n        *   *Setting:* Writing to a signal needs to notify dependents. How can an Agent notify others? Maybe it interacts with something?\n    *   **Computations/Memos:** Needs an Agent to hold the derived value and the computation function. It needs to know its dependencies (other Signal/Memo Agents). How does it recompute? How does it signal its own value changed?\n    *   **Effects:** Needs an Agent to hold the effect function. Needs dependencies. How does it run?\n    *   **Dependency Tracking:** This is the trickiest part. SolidJS uses a global stack/context during execution. Annette interactions are local. How can reading an Agent *inside* a computation automatically connect it? This seems hard with *just* standard Annette rules. Maybe the computation function itself needs to manage this? Or maybe we need special \"reader\" agents?\n\n4.  **Initial Architecture Idea 1 (Rule-Driven Updates):**\n    *   `SignalAgent`: Holds value. Has `value` port, maybe `setValue` port, `readValue` port?\n    *   `ComputedAgent`: Holds derived value and function. Has `value` port, maybe `dependency` ports?\n    *   `EffectAgent`: Holds effect function. `dependency` ports?\n    *   *Problem:* How does setting a `SignalAgent` trigger updates? If `SignalAgent` connects to `ComputedAgent`, the rule could fire. But *setting* the signal doesn\u0027t change the *connection*. It changes the *value*. Annette rules trigger on *connections*. This model seems flawed for value-based reactivity.\n\n5.  **Refine Architecture Idea 2 (Explicit Notification Agents):** Maybe setting a signal doesn\u0027t just change its value, but also creates a temporary \"Notifier\" Agent?\n    *   `SignalAgent(value)`: Holds the current value.\n    *   `ComputedAgent(fn, derivedValue)`: Holds computation function and cached value. Also holds a list/set of dependency `SignalAgent` names/references.\n    *   `EffectAgent(fn)`: Holds effect function and dependency list.\n    *   **Setting a Signal:**\n        1. Update the `SignalAgent`\u0027s internal value.\n        2. For each dependent `ComputedAgent` or `EffectAgent`: Create a `NotificationAgent`.\n        3. `connect(NotificationAgent, DependentAgent)`.\n    *   **Rules:**\n        *   `rule NotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputedAgent`: Mark `ComputedAgent` as dirty. Trigger network `reduce`.\n        *   `rule NotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`: Mark `EffectAgent` for execution. Trigger network `reduce`.\n    *   **Recomputing/Running:** How does a \"dirty\" `ComputedAgent` recompute? Maybe it needs another interaction?\n        *   Maybe the `reduce` loop checks for dirty agents and triggers their computation? This feels outside the pure interaction net model.\n        *   Alternative: The `NotificationAgent` rule *returns* a `ComputeTriggerAgent` connected to the `ComputedAgent`.\n        *   `rule ComputeTriggerAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputedAgent`: Execute `fn`, update `derivedValue`. If the value changed, create `NotificationAgent`s for *its* dependents and connect them. Return `[]` (consume trigger and agent, maybe return the updated ComputedAgent?).\n    *   **Reading a Signal (Dependency Tracking):** Still tricky. How does reading `signal.value` *inside* `ComputedAgent.fn` register the dependency?\n        *   Maybe the `fn` is executed with a special context object provided by the `ComputeTriggerAgent` interaction?\n        *   The context could have a `read(signalAgent)` method. Calling `context.read(signalAgent)` would:\n            1. Return `signalAgent.value`.\n            2. Register `signalAgent` as a dependency *on the ComputedAgent*. (Requires mutable state *within* the Agent/Rule).\n            3. *Connect* the `ComputedAgent` to the `SignalAgent` using specific \"dependency\" ports? (This feels more \"Annette-like\"). Let\u0027s explore this.\n\n6.  **Refine Architecture Idea 3 (Connection-Based Dependencies):**\n    *   `SignalAgent(value)`: Ports: `valueOut` (main?), `addDependent`, `removeDependent`. Internal state: `value`, `dependents` (list of agent names/refs?).\n    *   `ComputedAgent(fn, derivedValue)`: Ports: `valueOut` (main?), `addDependent`, `removeDependent`, `dependencyIn`, `computeTrigger`. Internal state: `value`, `fn`, `dependencies` (list), `dependents` (list).\n    *   `EffectAgent(fn)`: Ports: `dependencyIn`, `runTrigger`. Internal state: `fn`, `dependencies` (list).\n    *   **Computation Context:** When a `ComputedAgent` or `EffectAgent` runs its function (`fn`), it\u0027s given a \"context\". Reading a signal involves `context.read(signalAgent)`.\n    *   `context.read(signalAgent)`:\n        1.  Adds `signalAgent` to the current computation\u0027s dependency list.\n        2.  Creates a temporary `AddDependencyRequestAgent`.\n        3.  `connect(AddDependencyRequestAgent, signalAgent)`. The request agent carries the *dependent\u0027s* (the Computed/Effect Agent) reference.\n        4.  Returns `signalAgent.value`.\n    *   **Rules for Dependency:**\n        *   `rule AddDependencyRequestAgent(dependent) \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`: Add `dependent` to `SignalAgent.dependents`. Return `[]`.\n    *   **Setting a Signal:**\n        1.  Update `SignalAgent.value`.\n        2.  For each `dependent` in `SignalAgent.dependents`: Create a `NotifyAgent`.\n        3.  `connect(NotifyAgent, dependent)`.\n    *   **Rules for Notification:**\n        *   `rule NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputedAgent`: If `ComputedAgent` isn\u0027t already marked dirty, mark it dirty. Schedule a `ComputeTrigger` interaction? Or maybe just trigger `reduce` and have a later step handle dirty agents? Let\u0027s try the trigger approach: Create `ComputeTriggerAgent`. `connect(ComputeTriggerAgent, ComputedAgent)`. Return `[]`.\n        *   `rule NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`: Schedule effect? Create `RunTriggerAgent`. `connect(RunTriggerAgent, EffectAgent)`. Return `[]`.\n    *   **Rules for Execution:**\n        *   `rule ComputeTriggerAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputedAgent`:\n            1.  Run `fn` (with context for reading dependencies).\n            2.  Compare new value with old `derivedValue`.\n            3.  If changed, update `derivedValue`. For each `dependent` in `ComputedAgent.dependents`: create `NotifyAgent` and connect.\n            4.  Return `[ComputedAgent]` (or maybe `[]` if it\u0027s self-contained).\n        *   `rule RunTriggerAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`: Run `fn` (with context). Return `[]`.\n    *   **Memoization:** The `ComputeTriggerAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputedAgent` rule would only run if triggered. The value is cached on the `ComputedAgent`. This handles memoization naturally.\n    *   **Cleanup:** How are dependencies removed? SolidJS handles this automatically when computations re-run. In this model, the `ComputeTriggerAgent`/`RunTriggerAgent` rule would need to:\n        1.  Clear the old dependency list before running `fn`.\n        2.  Run `fn` which re-establishes dependencies via `context.read`.\n        3.  Compare the new dependency list with the (cleared) old one. For any dependencies no longer present, create `RemoveDependencyRequestAgent` and connect them to the relevant `SignalAgent`/`ComputedAgent`.\n        *   `rule RemoveDependencyRequestAgent(dependent) \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent/ComputedAgent`: Remove `dependent` from the `dependents` list. Return `[]`.\n\n7.  **Review and Identify Challenges:**\n    *   **Complexity:** This model introduces many temporary \"message\" agents (`NotifyAgent`, `ComputeTriggerAgent`, `AddDependencyRequestAgent`, etc.). The number of rules grows.\n    *   **Central Scheduler?:** Does `network.reduce()` handle everything? Or do we need an external loop to manage dirty flags or scheduled effects, breaking the pure interaction net model? Idea 3 tries to keep it within `reduce` using trigger agents.\n    *   **State within Agents:** Rules often need to modify the internal lists (`dependents`, `dependencies`) of agents, which fits Annette\u0027s model (`agent.value` is mutable).\n    *   **Context Passing:** Passing the `context` object into the `fn` during the `ComputeTrigger` interaction seems feasible within the rule\u0027s action.\n    *   **Performance:** Creating and connecting many temporary agents might have overhead compared to Solid\u0027s direct function calls and bitmask state tracking. Annette\u0027s `reduce` needs to efficiently find these connections.\n    *   **Garbage Collection:** Annette handles the *net structure* GC, but the values *inside* agents (like the `fn` closures, cached values, lists) rely on JS GC. Temporary agents should be cleaned up automatically by rules returning `[]`.\n\n8.  **Structure the Explanation:** Start with the mapping, explain the core agents, detail the processes (dependency tracking, update propagation, computation, effects), define the necessary rules conceptually, and finally discuss the pros/cons and challenges. Use diagrams mentally or sketch them out. Emphasize the translation from Solid\u0027s implicit context/stack to Annette\u0027s explicit connections/interactions.",

      "text": "Okay, this is a fascinating thought experiment! Building a fine-grained reactive library like SolidJS using Annette\u0027s interaction net model requires mapping Solid\u0027s concepts (signals, effects, memos, dependency tracking) onto Annette\u0027s primitives (Agents, Ports, Connections, Rules).\n\nHere\u0027s a potential architecture and conceptual breakdown:\n\n**Core Idea:** Represent reactive primitives (Signals, Computations, Effects) as specialized `Agent` types. Use connections and interaction rules to manage dependency tracking and update propagation. The `network.reduce()` cycle becomes the core scheduler.\n\n**1. Representing Reactive Primitives as Agents:**\n\n*   **`SignalAgent`**:\n    *   **Value:** Stores the actual reactive value.\n    *   **Ports (Conceptual):**\n        *   `valueOut` (Main Port?): Maybe not useful for interaction, but represents the signal itself.\n        *   `addSubscriber`: An input port to receive subscription requests.\n        *   `removeSubscriber`: An input port to receive unsubscription requests.\n        *   `setValueTrigger`: An input port to trigger a value update.\n    *   **Internal State (`agent.value`):** `{ currentValue: T, subscribers: Set\u003cSubscriberAgentRef\u003e }` (where `SubscriberAgentRef` is a way to reference a Computation or Effect agent).\n\n*   **`ComputationAgent` (Memo/Derived Signal):**\n    *   **Value:** Stores `{ computeFn: Function, dependencies: Set\u003cSignalAgentRef\u003e, subscribers: Set\u003cSubscriberAgentRef\u003e, cachedValue: T, isDirty: boolean }`.\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `valueOut` (Main Port?): Represents the computed value.\n        *   `addSubscriber`: Input port.\n        *   `removeSubscriber`: Input port.\n        *   `dependencyNotify`: Input port to receive notifications from dependencies.\n        *   `recomputeTrigger`: Input port to trigger re-computation.\n\n*   **`EffectAgent`:**\n    *   **Value:** Stores `{ effectFn: Function, dependencies: Set\u003cSignalAgentRef\u003e, isDirty: boolean }`.\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `dependencyNotify`: Input port.\n        *   `runTrigger`: Input port to trigger execution.\n\n*   **`SubscriberAgent` (Interface/Role):** Not a concrete agent type, but a role that `ComputationAgent` and `EffectAgent` fulfill. They need to be identifiable to be stored in subscriber lists.\n\n*   **Temporary \"Message\" Agents:** We\u0027ll likely need short-lived agents to carry information for interactions:\n    *   `SubscribeRequestAgent(subscriberRef)`\n    *   `UnsubscribeRequestAgent(subscriberRef)`\n    *   `SetValueAgent(newValue)`\n    *   `DependencyNotificationAgent`\n    *   `RecomputeRequestAgent`\n    *   `RunRequestAgent`\n\n**2. Dependency Tracking (The Tricky Part):**\n\nSolidJS uses a global stack during execution. Annette uses local interactions. We need to emulate the \"reading a signal subscribes the current computation\" mechanism.\n\n*   **Execution Context:** When a `ComputationAgent` or `EffectAgent` runs its function (`computeFn`/`effectFn`), it needs a way to register dependencies.\n*   **Approach:** The interaction rule that *triggers* the computation/effect (`RecomputeRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputationAgent` or `RunRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`) must:\n    1.  Establish a \"current execution context\" (perhaps by passing a special context object or agent reference to the `computeFn`/`effectFn`).\n    2.  Provide a `read(signalAgent)` function within that context.\n    3.  When `read(signalAgent)` is called *inside* the user\u0027s function:\n        *   It retrieves the `signalAgent`\u0027s current value.\n        *   It checks if the current `ComputationAgent`/`EffectAgent` (from the context) is already listed as a dependency for this `read` call. If not:\n            *   It adds the `signalAgent` to the *computation\u0027s* internal dependency list.\n            *   It creates a `SubscribeRequestAgent` containing the reference to the current `ComputationAgent`/`EffectAgent`.\n            *   It `connect()`s this `SubscribeRequestAgent` to the target `SignalAgent`\u0027s `addSubscriber` port.\n        *   It returns the value.\n    4.  Before running the user function, the triggering rule might need to clear the *old* dependencies and manage unsubscriptions (see Cleanup).\n\n**3. Update Propagation:**\n\n*   **Setting a Signal:**\n    1.  User code calls a `setSignal(signalAgent, newValue)` function (this function operates *within* the Annette network context).\n    2.  This function creates a `SetValueAgent(newValue)`.\n    3.  It `connect()`s `SetValueAgent` to the `signalAgent`\u0027s `setValueTrigger` port.\n*   **Rule `SetValueAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`:**\n    1.  Reads `newValue` from `SetValueAgent`.\n    2.  Compares `newValue` with `signalAgent.value.currentValue`.\n    3.  If different:\n        *   Updates `signalAgent.value.currentValue`.\n        *   Iterates through `signalAgent.value.subscribers`. For each `subscriberRef`:\n            *   Creates a `DependencyNotificationAgent`.\n            *   `connect()`s `DependencyNotificationAgent` to the subscriber agent\u0027s `dependencyNotify` port.\n    4.  Returns `[]` (consuming the `SetValueAgent` and maybe the `SignalAgent` if we want to enforce returning it).\n\n*   **Rule `DependencyNotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputationAgent`:**\n    1.  Checks if `computationAgent.value.isDirty` is false.\n    2.  If false:\n        *   Sets `computationAgent.value.isDirty \u003d true`.\n        *   Creates a `RecomputeRequestAgent`.\n        *   `connect()`s `RecomputeRequestAgent` to the `computationAgent`\u0027s `recomputeTrigger` port.\n    3.  Returns `[]`.\n\n*   **Rule `DependencyNotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`:**\n    1.  Checks if `effectAgent.value.isDirty` is false.\n    2.  If false:\n        *   Sets `effectAgent.value.isDirty \u003d true`.\n        *   Creates a `RunRequestAgent`.\n        *   `connect()`s `RunRequestAgent` to the `effectAgent`\u0027s `runTrigger` port.\n    3.  Returns `[]`.\n\n**4. Computation and Effects Execution:**\n\n*   **Rule `RecomputeRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e ComputationAgent`:**\n    1.  Sets `computationAgent.value.isDirty \u003d false`.\n    2.  **(Cleanup)** Clears old dependencies and triggers unsubscriptions if necessary.\n    3.  Runs `computationAgent.value.computeFn` using the special context for `read`.\n    4.  Gets the `newValue`.\n    5.  Compares `newValue` with `computationAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n    6.  If different:\n        *   Updates `computationAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n        *   Iterates through `computationAgent.value.subscribers`. For each `subscriberRef`:\n            *   Creates a `DependencyNotificationAgent`.\n            *   `connect()`s `DependencyNotificationAgent` to the subscriber\u0027s `dependencyNotify` port.\n    7.  Returns `[computationAgent]` (keeping the agent alive).\n\n*   **Rule `RunRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`:**\n    1.  Sets `effectAgent.value.isDirty \u003d false`.\n    2.  **(Cleanup)** Clears old dependencies and triggers unsubscriptions.\n    3.  Runs `effectAgent.value.effectFn` using the special context for `read`.\n    4.  Returns `[effectAgent]`.\n\n**5. Cleanup (Handling Unsubscriptions):**\n\n*   When a `ComputationAgent` or `EffectAgent` re-runs (`RecomputeRequestAgent` or `RunRequestAgent` interaction):\n    1.  Before running the user function, store the *old* set of dependencies.\n    2.  Clear the *current* dependency list on the agent.\n    3.  Run the user function (which re-populates the current dependency list via `read`).\n    4.  Compare the *old* set with the *new* set. For any dependency in the *old* set but not the *new* set:\n        *   Create an `UnsubscribeRequestAgent` containing the reference to the current `ComputationAgent`/`EffectAgent`.\n        *   `connect()` this `UnsubscribeRequestAgent` to the corresponding `SignalAgent`\u0027s `removeSubscriber` port.\n*   **Rule `SubscribeRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`:** Adds the subscriber to the `subscribers` set. Returns `[]`.\n*   **Rule `UnsubscribeRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`:** Removes the subscriber from the `subscribers` set. Returns `[]`.\n\n**Annette Network Role:**\n\n*   The `Network` holds all these agents (`Signal`, `Computation`, `Effect`, and temporary ones).\n*   `network.reduce()` drives the entire process. A single `setSignal` call would trigger a cascade of connections and rule firings within one or more `reduce` cycles until the system stabilizes (no more connections match rules).\n\n**Pros of this approach (Theoretical):**\n\n*   Leverages Annette\u0027s core interaction model.\n*   Update propagation is handled via local interactions.\n*   Resource management for the temporary \"message\" agents is handled naturally by Annette rules returning `[]`.\n\n**Cons and Challenges:**\n\n*   **Complexity:** Many agent types and rules are needed compared to Solid\u0027s direct function calls and stack management. Debugging could be complex.\n*   **Overhead:** Creating/connecting/reducing many temporary agents might be less performant than Solid\u0027s optimized dependency tracking and direct execution. Annette\u0027s `reduce` efficiency is critical.\n*   **Boilerplate:** Defining signals, effects, etc., might require more setup (creating the initial Agents within the network).\n*   **Context Management:** Ensuring the correct execution context is passed during computation/effect execution is crucial and adds complexity to the rules.\n*   **Bridging:** How do you bridge this internal Annette network state to external systems like the DOM? Effects would need to perform actions outside the network.\n*   **Atomicity:** Ensuring updates are atomic might require careful rule design or potentially batching mechanisms layered on top of `reduce`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt seems *possible* to model a SolidJS-like reactive system using Annette\u0027s interaction nets. However, it requires translating Solid\u0027s implicit, stack-based dependency tracking and direct function execution into an explicit system of connections, temporary message agents, and interaction rules. The resulting system would likely be more verbose and potentially less performant than native SolidJS, but it would be a fascinating demonstration of the expressiveness of the interaction net model applied to fine-grained reactivity. The core challenge lies in efficiently and correctly managing the dynamic dependency graph through local interactions.",

      "text": "The user wants a *more elegant* way to build a SolidJS-like library using Annette, suggesting the previous approach was too complex and perhaps missed a simpler mapping between the concepts. The key is to leverage Annette\u0027s core strengths rather than just reimplementing Solid\u0027s mechanisms with Annette\u0027s primitives.\n\nWhat are Annette\u0027s core strengths?\n1.  **Local Interactions:** Computation happens between connected agents.\n2.  **Graph Rewriting:** Interactions change the graph structure (consume/produce agents/connections).\n3.  **Implicit Resource Management:** Consumed agents are gone if not returned.\n4.  **Declarative Rules:** Define behavior based on connection patterns.\n\nWhat are Solid\u0027s core needs?\n1.  **State Holding:** Signals hold values.\n2.  **Derived State:** Computations derive values from others.\n3.  **Side Effects:** Effects run based on changes.\n4.  **Dependency Tracking:** Knowing what depends on what.\n5.  **Update Propagation:** Notifying dependents when a source changes.\n\nLet\u0027s rethink the mapping, aiming for simplicity and elegance.\n\n**Simplification Idea 1: Embed Dependency Info Directly in Connections/Agents**\n\nInstead of complex context passing and `SubscribeRequestAgent`s, can dependency be represented more directly?\n\n*   Maybe a `ComputationAgent` doesn\u0027t just hold a *reference* to its dependencies, but is *directly connected* to them?\n*   When a `SignalAgent` value changes, how does it notify dependents?\n\n**Alternative Approach: Focus on Dataflow via Connections**\n\n1.  **`SignalAgent(initialValue)`:**\n    *   `value`: Holds the current value `T`.\n    *   `ports`:\n        *   `value_out!`: *Principal port*. Represents the *current value stream*. Other agents connect *to* this port to read the value.\n        *   `update_in`: An input port to receive a new value.\n\n2.  **`MapAgent(mapFn)` (like Solid\u0027s `createMemo` or simple derived signal):**\n    *   `value`: Holds `{ fn: Function, cachedValue: T | undefined }`.\n    *   `ports`:\n        *   `source_in!`: *Principal port*. Connects to the `value_out` of the source Signal/MapAgent.\n        *   `value_out`: Represents the *mapped value stream*. Other agents connect to this.\n\n3.  **`EffectAgent(effectFn)`:**\n    *   `value`: Holds `{ fn: Function }`.\n    *   `ports`:\n        *   `source_in!`: *Principal port*. Connects to the `value_out` of the source Signal/MapAgent.\n\n**Interaction Rules for Propagation:**\n\n*   **Updating a Signal:** Send a new value to its `update_in` port. How? Maybe a temporary `UpdateValueAgent(newValue)`?\n    *   `Rule UpdateValueAgent(value) \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent(currentValue, ...)`\n        *   If `value !\u003d\u003d currentValue`:\n            *   Update `SignalAgent.value \u003d value`.\n            *   **Crucially:** How does it propagate? Annette rules usually operate between *two* specific agents. The `SignalAgent` might need to know its direct dependents to *actively* propagate. This feels less elegant and back towards the complex subscription model.\n\n*   **What if the connection *is* the subscription?** When `MapAgent` connects its `source_in` to `SignalAgent`\u0027s `value_out`, that *is* the subscription.\n\nLet\u0027s refine this: Connections represent dataflow dependencies. Interactions handle the *propagation*.\n\n**Refined Approach:**\n\n1.  **`DataNodeAgent` (Base for Signal/Map):**\n    *   `value`: Stores the current data `{ v: T }`.\n    *   `ports`:\n        *   `data_out!`: Principal output port, representing the *stable* current value.\n        *   `notify_out`: An *auxiliary* output port used to send *change notifications*.\n        *   `update_in`: Input port to receive new values (for Signals).\n        *   `dependency_in`: Input port to receive change notifications from dependencies (for Maps/Effects).\n\n2.  **`SignalAgent(initialValue)`:** Inherits from `DataNodeAgent`.\n\n3.  **`MapAgent(mapFn)`:** Inherits from `DataNodeAgent`. Also holds the `mapFn` in its value.\n\n4.  **`EffectAgent(effectFn)`:**\n    *   `value`: `{ fn: Function }`.\n    *   `ports`:\n        *   `dependency_in!`: Principal input port, receiving change notifications.\n\n**Connections Establish the DAG:**\n\n*   A `MapAgent` connects its `dependency_in` port to the `notify_out` port of its source `DataNodeAgent`.\n*   An `EffectAgent` connects its `dependency_in` port to the `notify_out` port of its source `DataNodeAgent`.\n*   Reading a value means conceptually reading from the `data_out` port (though this might not involve an *interaction*, just accessing the connected agent\u0027s value if needed).\n\n**Interaction Rules for Propagation:**\n\n*   **User updates signal:** `connect(UpdateValueAgent(newValue), signalAgent.update_in)`\n*   **Rule: `UpdateValueAgent(newValue) \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`**\n    1.  Read `currentValue` from `SignalAgent.value.v`.\n    2.  If `newValue !\u003d\u003d currentValue`:\n        *   Update `SignalAgent.value.v \u003d newValue`.\n        *   Create a `NotificationAgent()`.\n        *   **Problem:** How to connect `NotificationAgent` to *all* dependents listening on `notify_out`? Annette connections are typically 1-to-1 between ports. A single port can only connect to one other port. This is a major mismatch with the 1-to-many nature of signal dependencies.\n\n**Addressing the 1-to-Many Problem:**\n\n*   **Idea A: Duplicator Nodes:** Interaction nets have duplicator nodes (`dup`). When a signal needs to notify multiple dependents, could it interact with a chain or tree of `dup`-like agents connected to its `notify_out`? The `dup` nodes would replicate the notification signal.\n    *   `SignalAgent --notify_out--\u003e DupAgent --out1--\u003e Dependent1`\n    *   `                     `--out2--\u003e DupAgent --out1--\u003e Dependent2`\n    *   `                                       `--out2--\u003e ...`\n    *   This seems plausible within the interaction net model. Each dependent connects to an \"output\" port of a duplicator tree originating from the signal\u0027s `notify_out`.\n    *   When `SignalAgent` interacts with the first `DupAgent` (via a `NotificationAgent`), the `DupAgent` interaction rule would replicate the notification down its branches.\n\n*   **Idea B: Agent Holds Dependents:** Abandon purity slightly? The `SignalAgent` explicitly stores a list of `dependentAgentRefs` in its `value`. The rule `UpdateValueAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent` iterates this list and creates/connects `NotificationAgent`s directly to each dependent\u0027s `dependency_in`. This breaks the pure \"local interaction only\" model somewhat but might be pragmatic. It mirrors the previous complex approach.\n\n*   **Idea C: Focus on the \u0027Pull\u0027 aspect:** Maybe notifications aren\u0027t explicit agents. Maybe dependents *pull* when notified.\n    *   Rule `UpdateValueAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`: Updates value, then connects a `DirtyMarkerAgent` to the `SignalAgent`\u0027s `notify_out`?\n    *   Rule `DirtyMarkerAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent` (connected via `notify_out` -\u003e `dependency_in`): Marks the `MapAgent` as dirty. If it wasn\u0027t already dirty, it connects a `DirtyMarkerAgent` to its *own* `notify_out`.\n    *   Rule `DirtyMarkerAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`: Triggers the effect execution (which would then read values).\n    *   How does a `MapAgent` recompute? It only computes when its value is *read*. This aligns with Solid\u0027s lazy computation.\n    *   Reading: When something tries to read from a `MapAgent`\u0027s `data_out` port (how?), if it\u0027s dirty, it triggers a recompute. The recompute reads from its sources\u0027 `data_out` ports (potentially triggering their recompute if dirty).\n\n**Let\u0027s pursue Idea A (Duplicators) combined with Idea C (Lazy Pull for Computations):**\n\n1.  **Agents:**\n    *   `SignalAgent(value)`: Ports `update_in`, `notify_out!`. Holds value.\n    *   `DupAgent()`: Ports `source_in!`, `notify_out1`, `notify_out2`. Used to fan-out notifications.\n    *   `MapAgent(fn, initialDeps)`: Ports `dependency_in!`, `notify_out`. Holds `{ fn, dependencies: Agent[], cachedValue, isDirty }`. Dependencies are the *SignalAgents* it reads.\n    *   `EffectAgent(fn, initialDeps)`: Ports `dependency_in!`. Holds `{ fn, dependencies: Agent[] }`.\n    *   `ReadRequestAgent()`: Used to trigger reading/computation.\n    *   `NotificationAgent()`: Carries the notification.\n\n2.  **Connections:**\n    *   `MapAgent.dependency_in` connects to the `notify_out` of a source (or a `DupAgent` output fed by the source).\n    *   `EffectAgent.dependency_in` connects similarly.\n    *   Crucially: Dependencies (`MapAgent.value.dependencies`, `EffectAgent.value.dependencies`) are determined *during* the initial computation/effect run (like Solid). This setup phase still needs thought - perhaps it involves temporary connections during the run.\n\n3.  **Update Flow (Signal Update):**\n    *   `connect(UpdateValueAgent(newValue), signalAgent.update_in)`\n    *   **Rule: `UpdateValueAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`:**\n        *   Update value if changed.\n        *   If changed, `connect(NotificationAgent(), signalAgent.notify_out)`.\n        *   Return `[signalAgent]`.\n    *   **Rule: `NotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e DupAgent`:**\n        *   `connect(NotificationAgent(), dupAgent.notify_out1)`\n        *   `connect(NotificationAgent(), dupAgent.notify_out2)`\n        *   Return `[]` (consume original notification and DupAgent, maybe return *new* DupAgents if they need state?). Or maybe the DupAgent persists and just relays? Let\u0027s assume it persists for simplicity. Return `[dupAgent]`.\n    *   **Rule: `NotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent`:**\n        *   If not dirty, set `mapAgent.value.isDirty \u003d true`.\n        *   `connect(NotificationAgent(), mapAgent.notify_out)` (Propagate notification).\n        *   Return `[mapAgent]`.\n    *   **Rule: `NotificationAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent`:**\n        *   **(Immediate Execution - like `createEffect`)** Trigger effect execution: `connect(RunRequestAgent(), effectAgent.dependency_in)`? Or maybe the rule just runs the effect directly? Let\u0027s try direct run for now.\n        *   *Run effect function*. During the run, use a mechanism to read values (see below).\n        *   Return `[effectAgent]`.\n\n4.  **Reading / Computation Flow (Map Read):**\n    *   User/Effect needs value from `mapAgent`. How? Maybe `connect(ReadRequestAgent(), mapAgent.dependency_in)`? (Overloading `dependency_in` seems confusing). Let\u0027s add a `read_request_in` port.\n    *   `connect(ReadRequestAgent(requesterPort), mapAgent.read_request_in)`\n    *   **Rule: `ReadRequestAgent(requesterPort) \u003c-\u003e MapAgent`:**\n        *   If `mapAgent.value.isDirty`:\n            *   Set `isDirty \u003d false`.\n            *   **(Dependency Reading)** For each dependency `dep` in `mapAgent.value.dependencies`:\n                *   Need to synchronously get `dep`\u0027s value. This is the tricky part in an async interaction model. Maybe `read` involves creating temporary `ReadRequestAgent`s for dependencies and waiting? This seems overly complex.\n            *   **(Alternative Dependency Reading)** Can the rule *directly access* the value of connected agents? Let\u0027s assume yes for elegance. Read current values from all dependency agents.\n            *   Run `mapAgent.value.fn` with dependency values.\n            *   Update `mapAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n        *   Get `mapAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n        *   Send this value back to the `requesterPort`. How? Create `ValueDeliveryAgent(value)` and connect it to `requesterPort`.\n        *   Return `[mapAgent]`.\n\n**Revisiting Elegance:**\n\n*   The use of `DupAgent` feels idiomatic to interaction nets for handling fan-out.\n*   Triggering updates via connecting temporary agents (`UpdateValueAgent`, `NotificationAgent`) also feels right.\n*   The main complexity remains in:\n    1.  **Synchronous Read during Computation:** Interaction nets are often presented with parallel/async reduction. How does a `MapAgent` *synchronously* get the current, potentially recomputed values of its dependencies within a single rule execution? This might require the Annette implementation to allow direct value access to connected agents *within* a rule, or a more complex request/response pattern using temporary agents. Direct access is more elegant if feasible.\n    2.  **Initial Dependency Tracking:** How does the `MapAgent` or `EffectAgent` know its dependencies initially? Solid uses the execution stack. Maybe the first run involves temporary connections or a special \"tracking\" mode passed to the function.\n\n**Elegant Core Idea:**\n\n*   **Signals are `SignalAgents`**.\n*   **Computations/Effects are `Map/EffectAgents`**.\n*   **Dependencies are modeled structurally:** `Map/EffectAgent` connects its `dependency_in` to the source\u0027s `notify_out` (potentially via `DupAgents`).\n*   **Updates propagate via `NotificationAgent`s** flowing through the dependency connections (`notify_out` -\u003e `dependency_in`) and `DupAgent`s.\n*   **Computations (`MapAgent`) are lazy:** Triggered by a read request (`ReadRequestAgent`) only if marked dirty by a notification. Re-computation *reads* current values directly from dependencies (assuming the Annette implementation allows this within a rule).\n*   **Effects (`EffectAgent`) are triggered** by notifications arriving at `dependency_in`, and they run their function, reading current values.\n\nThis feels much closer to an elegant mapping. The main deviation from pure interaction net theory might be the need for a rule to directly read the `value` of another agent it knows about (its dependencies) without necessarily requiring a separate interaction *just* for the read. If the Annette library allows `agent.value` access within rules, this becomes much cleaner. The `DupAgent` handles the 1-to-many notification elegantly using standard interaction net concepts.",

We don\u0027t need to perfectly replicate Solid\u0027s *exact* internal mechanisms, but rather its *behavioral contract*.\n\n**Core Idea:** Model the reactive graph directly with persistent agents and connections. Use interaction rules primarily for change propagation and triggering computations/effects. Minimize temporary agents.\n\n**1. Reactive Primitives as Agents:**\n\n*   **`SignalAgent\u003cT\u003e`:**\n    *   **Value:** `{ current: T }`\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `update_in`: Port to receive new values.\n        *   `value_out!`: **Principal Port**. Represents the *stable value stream*. Dependents connect *here* to signify dependency.\n\n*   **`MapAgent\u003cT\u003e` (Memo/Computed):**\n    *   **Value:** `{ computeFn: () \u003d\u003e T, dependencies: SignalAgent\u003cany\u003e[], cached: T, dirty: boolean }`\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `trigger_in`: Port to receive notifications from dependencies.\n        *   `value_out!`: **Principal Port**. Represents the *stable computed value stream*. Other dependents connect here.\n\n*   **`EffectAgent`:**\n    *   **Value:** `{ effectFn: () \u003d\u003e void, dependencies: SignalAgent\u003cany\u003e[] }`\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `trigger_in!`: **Principal Port**. Receives notifications to run the effect.\n\n**2. Connections Represent the Dependency Graph:**\n\n*   When a `MapAgent` or `EffectAgent` is created:\n    *   It runs its function once (`computeFn` or `effectFn`) in a *tracking context*.\n    *   This context identifies `SignalAgent` reads.\n    *   For each read dependency (`SignalAgent`), the system establishes a **persistent connection**:\n        *   `connect(signalAgent.value_out, mapAgent.trigger_in)`\n        *   `connect(signalAgent.value_out, effectAgent.trigger_in)`\n    *   The agent stores its direct dependencies (`SignalAgent` instances) in its `value`.\n\n**3. Interaction Rules for Propagation and Execution:**\n\n*   **Updating a Signal:**\n    *   User calls `update(signalAgent, newValue)`.\n    *   This function creates a temporary `UpdateAgent(newValue)`.\n    *   `connect(updateAgent, signalAgent.update_in)`\n\n    *   **Rule: `UpdateAgent(newValue) \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`**\n        1.  Get `currentValue` from `SignalAgent.value.current`.\n        2.  If `newValue !\u003d\u003d currentValue`:\n            *   Update `SignalAgent.value.current \u003d newValue`.\n            *   **Crucially:** Create a temporary `NotifyAgent()`.\n            *   `connect(notifyAgent, signalAgent.value_out)` // Connect notification to the *output* port.\n        3.  Return `[signalAgent]` (keep the signal alive, consume `UpdateAgent`).\n\n*   **Propagating Notifications:**\n    *   The `NotifyAgent` is now connected to the `SignalAgent.value_out`. This port might be connected to multiple `trigger_in` ports of dependents (`MapAgent`, `EffectAgent`). Annette needs a mechanism to handle this fan-out.\n    *   **Option A (Annette Implicit Fan-out):** If Annette allows a principal port (`value_out`) to be connected to *multiple* auxiliary ports (`trigger_in`), the single `NotifyAgent` connection could trigger multiple rules simultaneously or sequentially.\n    *   **Option B (Annette Explicit Fan-out via Rule):** The `NotifyAgent` connection triggers *one* rule, perhaps with a special \"Router\" agent implicitly managed by the framework or a specific rule designed to handle fan-out if the `value_out` is connected to a special `FanOutHelperAgent`. This feels less elegant.\n    *   **Option C (Assume 1-to-1, Use Duplicators - revisited):** If Annette strictly enforces 1-to-1 port connections, the initial `connect` during dependency tracking must insert `DupAgent` chains between the `signalAgent.value_out` and multiple `map/effect.trigger_in` ports. The `NotifyAgent` then interacts with the start of this duplication chain.\n        *   `Rule: NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e DupAgent` -\u003e Creates two `NotifyAgent`s connected to the Dup outputs.\n        *   This seems the most interaction-net idiomatic if 1-to-1 is strict.\n\n    *   **Rule: `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent` (connected `signal.value_out` -\u003e `map.trigger_in`)**\n        1.  If `!mapAgent.value.dirty`:\n            *   Set `mapAgent.value.dirty \u003d true`.\n            *   Create `NotifyAgent()`.\n            *   `connect(notifyAgent, mapAgent.value_out)` // Propagate dirtiness/notification downstream.\n        2.  Return `[mapAgent]` (keep map agent, consume `NotifyAgent`).\n\n    *   **Rule: `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent` (connected `signal.value_out` -\u003e `effect.trigger_in`)**\n        1.  // Re-run the effect immediately\n        2.  Clear old dependencies (needs mechanism).\n        3.  Run `effectAgent.value.effectFn()` in tracking context (updates dependencies).\n        4.  Establish new/remove old connections based on changed dependencies.\n        5.  Return `[effectAgent]` (keep effect agent, consume `NotifyAgent`).\n\n*   **Lazy Computation (Reading a MapAgent):**\n    *   Solid computes lazily. How do we trigger this? Reading needs to be an operation within the network.\n    *   User/Effect calls `read(mapAgent)`.\n    *   This function creates `ReadRequestAgent(replyPort)`. (Need a way to get the result back).\n    *   `connect(readRequestAgent, mapAgent.value_out)` (Connecting to the output port signifies a read request).\n\n    *   **Rule: `ReadRequestAgent(replyPort) \u003c-\u003e MapAgent`**\n        1.  If `mapAgent.value.dirty`:\n            *   Set `dirty \u003d false`.\n            *   **(Synchronous Dependency Read)** This rule needs to get the *current* values of its dependencies. This requires either:\n                *   Direct access: `mapAgent.value.dependencies.map(dep \u003d\u003e dep.value.current)`. (Simplest if allowed).\n                *   Triggering reads on dependencies: `connect(ReadRequestAgent(myInternalReplyPort), dep.value_out)` for each dependency and somehow waiting/coordinating results. (Very complex).\n            *   Assuming direct access: Get current values from dependencies.\n            *   Run `mapAgent.value.computeFn()` with values.\n            *   Update `mapAgent.value.cached`.\n            *   **(Dependency Update)** Handle changes in dependencies discovered during `computeFn` run (connect/disconnect).\n        2.  Get `mapAgent.value.cached`.\n        3.  Create `ValueResponseAgent(cachedValue)`.\n        4.  `connect(valueResponseAgent, replyPort)`. // Send result back.\n        5.  Return `[mapAgent]` (consume `ReadRequestAgent`).\n\n**Elegance Achieved?**\n\n*   **Persistent Graph:** The core reactive graph is built with persistent agents and connections, directly mirroring dependencies.\n*   **Local Propagation:** Change notification (`NotifyAgent`) flows locally along existing connections (potentially via `DupAgent`s).\n*   **Rule-Driven:** Updates, notifications, effect executions, and lazy computations are all triggered by specific interaction rules initiated by temporary \"intent\" agents (`UpdateAgent`, `ReadRequestAgent`).\n*   **Leverages Ports:** Different ports (`update_in`, `trigger_in`, `value_out`) handle different semantic roles (receiving updates, receiving triggers, representing stable value / dependency source). `value_out` being the principal port makes sense, as it represents the primary output.\n\n**Remaining Hurdles for Ultimate Elegance:**\n\n1.  **Fan-out (`value_out` to multiple `trigger_in`):** Needs a clear, efficient mechanism within Annette (implicit, DupAgents, or other). DupAgents seem most likely.\n2.  **Synchronous Reads for Computation:** The ability for a `MapAgent` rule to synchronously get dependency values is crucial for simplicity. If Annette forces *everything* through asynchronous interactions, lazy computation becomes much harder.\n3.  **Initial Dependency Tracking \u0026 Updates:** Running functions in a tracking context and dynamically updating connections based on dependency changes still requires careful implementation within the rules (`EffectAgent` rule, `MapAgent` read rule).\n\n**Architecture Summary:**\n\n1.  **State:** `SignalAgent` holds raw state.\n2.  **Derivation:** `MapAgent` holds computation logic, computes lazily.\n3.  **Effects:** `EffectAgent` holds side-effect logic, runs eagerly on change.\n4.  **Structure:** Persistent connections (`value_out` -\u003e `trigger_in`, possibly via `DupAgent` trees) form the static dependency graph.\n5.  **Dynamics:** Temporary agents (`UpdateAgent`, `NotifyAgent`, `ReadRequestAgent`, `ValueResponseAgent`) trigger interactions.\n6.  **Execution:** Interaction rules handle value updates, notification propagation, lazy computation, effect execution, and dependency graph maintenance.\n7.  **Scheduler:** `network.reduce()` drives all updates until quiescence.\n\nThis feels like a more streamlined approach that maps reactive concepts onto interaction net structures more directly than the first attempt. The elegance hinges on how well Annette handles fan-out and whether synchronous value access within rules is feasible.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process for reviewing and refining the Annette-based reactive library design:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** Build a SolidJS-like *reactive* system using Annette\u0027s *interaction net* model. Focus on elegance and leverage Annette\u0027s strengths. Key Solid features: signals (state), computed/memo (derived state, lazy), effects (side effects, eager).\n\n2.  **Initial Proposal Review (Second Attempt):**\n    *   **Agents:** `SignalAgent`, `MapAgent`, `EffectAgent`. Good core mapping.\n    *   **Connections:** Persistent connections (`value_out` -\u003e `trigger_in`) represent the dependency graph. Seems clean.\n    *   **Principal Ports:** `value_out` for Signals/Maps (source), `trigger_in` for Effects (sink). Makes sense.\n    *   **Triggers:** Temporary agents (`UpdateAgent`, `NotifyAgent`, `ReadRequestAgent`) initiate interactions. Reduces rule complexity.\n    *   **Propagation:** `NotifyAgent` travels along connections.\n\n3.  **Identify Hurdles/Weak Points (from previous step):**\n    *   **Hurdle 1: Fan-out.** How does a single `NotifyAgent` interaction on `signal.value_out` trigger *all* connected dependents (`map/effect.trigger_in`)?\n        *   *Option A (Implicit Fan-out):* Unlikely in pure interaction nets? Needs clarification on Annette\u0027s specifics. Assume not possible for robustness.\n        *   *Option B (Router Agent):* Adds complexity, less elegant.\n        *   *Option C (DupAgents):* Most idiomatic for interaction nets if 1-to-1 is strict. This means the dependency graph isn\u0027t *just* `signal -\u003e map`, but `signal -\u003e dup -\u003e map`, `signal -\u003e dup -\u003e dup -\u003e effect`, etc. This adds structural complexity during dependency tracking. *Refinement needed here.*\n    *   **Hurdle 2: Synchronous Reads for Computation.** `MapAgent` needs current values of dependencies *during its interaction*. Direct access (`agent.value.dependencies[i].value.current`) breaks the pure interaction model. Triggering nested `ReadRequestAgent` interactions makes the `MapAgent` rule asynchronous and complex (coordination needed). *This is a major conceptual conflict between reactive pull (Map) and interaction net push/rewrite.* *Refinement needed here.*\n    *   **Hurdle 3: Dependency Tracking \u0026 Updates.** Running user code within a rule (`EffectAgent`, `MapAgent`) and dynamically changing connections based on reads *during that rule\u0027s execution* feels complex and potentially violates the local nature of interactions. The rule should ideally just process its inputs and produce outputs/new connections, not run arbitrary user code that interacts back with the network *synchronously*. *Refinement needed here.*\n    *   **Hurdle 4: Read Result Return:** `ReadRequestAgent` needs a `replyPort`. How is this port created and managed? Feels slightly ad-hoc.\n\n4.  **Refinement - Addressing Hurdles:**\n\n    *   **Refining Fan-out (Hurdle 1):** Embrace `DupAgent`.\n        *   **Dependency Tracking:** When `read(signal)` happens in context, don\u0027t just connect `signal.value_out -\u003e dependent.trigger_in`. Instead, check if `signal.value_out` is already connected.\n            *   If not connected: Connect `signal.value_out -\u003e dependent.trigger_in`.\n            *   If connected (to one other dependent): Introduce a `DupAgent`. Connect `signal.value_out -\u003e dup.in`, `dup.out1 -\u003e old_dependent.trigger_in`, `dup.out2 -\u003e new_dependent.trigger_in`.\n            *   If connected (to a `DupAgent`): Add the new dependent to the duplication tree (might need more complex duplication agents or chains).\n        *   **Propagation Rule:** `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e DupAgent` becomes essential. It consumes one `NotifyAgent` and produces two `NotifyAgent`s connected to the outputs. This propagates the notification down the tree.\n        *   **Cleanup:** Removing a dependency requires removing the agent from the `DupAgent` tree and potentially collapsing the tree. This adds complexity to cleanup rules.\n\n    *   **Refining Synchronous Reads / Computation (Hurdle 2 \u0026 3):** This is the biggest conflict. We *cannot* have synchronous reads/computation *within* a standard interaction rule without breaking the model. Let\u0027s rethink `MapAgent`.\n        *   **Idea:** `MapAgent` doesn\u0027t compute *during* the notification rule. It just marks itself dirty and propagates. Computation *only* happens when explicitly read.\n        *   **Revised `MapAgent`:**\n            *   Value: `{ computeFn: () \u003d\u003e T, dependencies: AgentRef[], *lastKnownDepValues*: any[], cachedValue: T, dirty: boolean }`\n            *   Ports: `trigger_in`, `value_out!`\n        *   **Revised Rule (`NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent`):**\n            1.  Mark `dirty \u003d true`.\n            2.  Propagate `NotifyAgent` via `value_out` (if needed for downstream maps/effects depending on this map).\n            3.  Return `[mapAgent]`. *No computation here.*\n        *   **Revised Read (`ReadRequestAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent`):**\n            1.  If `dirty`:\n                *   **Trigger dependency reads:** For *each* dependency `dep` in `dependencies`: create `ReadRequestAgent(internalReplyPort_depX)` and connect to `dep.value_out`.\n                *   **Wait/Collect:** The `MapAgent` now needs internal state to track pending reads and collect results. When all `ValueResponseAgent(depValue)` arrive at `internalReplyPort_depX`, store the `depValue` in `lastKnownDepValues`.\n                *   **Compute:** Once all dependency values are collected, run `computeFn(lastKnownDepValues)`. Update `cachedValue`. Set `dirty \u003d false`.\n                *   **Dependency Tracking:** (Still complex) Run `computeFn` *again* in tracking mode to find new dependencies. Update connections/Dup trees.\n                *   **Respond:** Send `ValueResponseAgent(cachedValue)` to the original `replyPort`.\n            2.  If not `dirty`: Send `ValueResponseAgent(cachedValue)` immediately.\n            3.  Return `[mapAgent]`.\n        *   *Consequence:* This makes reading a `MapAgent` inherently asynchronous from the network\u0027s perspective. The user\u0027s `read(mapAgent)` call cannot return synchronously if a recomputation involving network reads is needed. This deviates significantly from Solid\u0027s synchronous read behavior.\n\n    *   **Refining Dependency Tracking (Hurdle 3):**\n        *   Separate tracking from execution.\n        *   Tracking run happens *first* (`EffectAgent` activation, `MapAgent` read activation).\n        *   This tracking run *only* determines the list of dependencies.\n        *   Based on the *new* vs *old* dependency list, rules are triggered to add/remove connections (introducing/removing `DupAgent`s).\n        *   *Then*, the actual computation (`MapAgent` post-read) or effect (`EffectAgent`) runs using the now stable dependency values (fetched asynchronously if needed for Map).\n\n    *   **Refining Read Result (Hurdle 4):**\n        *   The `replyPort` needs to be a real port on an agent. The agent initiating the read (`EffectAgent` or maybe a temporary `UserReadCoordinatorAgent`) needs to create an internal port to receive the response.\n        *   `read(mapAgent)` function creates `UserReadCoordinatorAgent` with a `response_in` port. Connects `ReadRequestAgent(this.response_in)` to `mapAgent.value_out`. The Coordinator then waits for a `ValueResponseAgent` interaction on its `response_in`.\n        *   *Problem:* How does the original *user code* that called `read()` get the value back synchronously? It can\u0027t, if network interactions are needed. The bridge between synchronous user code and the asynchronous network reduction is the issue.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluation \u0026 Alternative View:**\n\n    *   The asynchronous nature forced by interaction nets for computed reads is a major departure from Solid. Is there another way?\n    *   What if `network.reduce()` isn\u0027t just a blind scheduler, but can be called *re-entrantly* or *synchronously* as part of a rule\u0027s execution (if carefully managed)? This breaks pure interaction net ideas but might be a pragmatic compromise *if* Annette allows it. Assume *not* for now.\n    *   **Alternative:** Embrace the asynchronicity. The `read` function for a computed value *must* return a Promise or require a callback if recomputation is needed. This is more like RxJS streams than Solid signals.\n    *   **Alternative 2:** Use Annette primarily for the *propagation* and *triggering*, but perform the actual *computation* and *dependency tracking* outside the core interaction rules, perhaps in the functions that *create* the temporary agents?\n        *   `update(signalAgent, newValue)`: Creates `UpdateAgent`. Connects it. *Calls `network.reduce()`*.\n        *   `read(mapAgent)`: If dirty, run computeFn *synchronously* (using standard JS stack tracking), determine dependencies, calculate value, update dependencies/connections *via Annette rules* (create Connect/Disconnect agents?), update cache, return value.\n        *   This hybrid approach uses Annette more as a structured event bus and graph manager than the sole computation engine.\n\n6.  **Final Refined Direction (Hybrid Approach):** This seems most promising for achieving Solid-like *behavior* even if the *internals* differ.\n\n    *   **Agents:** `SignalAgent`, `MapAgent` (stores fn, cache, deps), `EffectAgent` (stores fn, deps).\n    *   **Connections:** Persistent `value_out -\u003e trigger_in` (via `DupAgent` trees) for notification.\n    *   **Updates:** `update()` creates `UpdateAgent`, connects, calls `reduce()`. Rule `UpdateAgent\u003c-\u003eSignalAgent` updates value, creates `NotifyAgent`, connects to `value_out`, returns `[signalAgent]`.\n    *   **Propagation:** `reduce()` processes `NotifyAgent` through `DupAgent` tree. Rule `NotifyAgent\u003c-\u003eMapAgent` marks dirty, propagates Notify. Rule `NotifyAgent\u003c-\u003eEffectAgent` schedules effect *outside* the rule (e.g., add to a queue).\n    *   **Scheduler:** After `reduce()` finishes, process the effect queue. Running an effect uses synchronous tracking.\n    *   **Reads:** `read(signal)` \u003d direct value access. `read(map)`: If dirty, run computeFn *synchronously* (with tracking), update cache/dependencies (queue connection changes?), return value. Queued connection changes processed on next `update/effect`.\n    *   **Dependency Management:** Synchronous tracking determines needed connections. Connection/Disconnection requests are queued and processed by `reduce()` using specific `ConnectAgent`/`DisconnectAgent` interactions with `DupAgent` trees.\n\n7.  **Self-Correction:** This hybrid approach significantly reduces the reliance on complex asynchronous coordination within Annette rules for reads. It uses Annette for its strengths: graph structure, local interactions for notification propagation, and managing the connection graph structure. The synchronous computation/tracking happens outside the core interaction rules, triggered *by* them. This feels more pragmatic.",

The core challenge lies in reconciling Solid\u0027s synchronous, stack-based dependency tracking and lazy evaluation with Annette\u0027s asynchronous, local interaction model.\n\nThe previous refinement revealed that forcing *all* logic (including reads and computations) into interaction rules leads to significant complexity, especially regarding synchronous reads and dynamic dependency updates.\n\n**Refined Approach: Hybrid Model - Annette for Graph \u0026 Propagation, JS for Sync Logic**\n\nThis approach uses Annette for what it excels at (graph structure, local propagation) and standard JavaScript execution for synchronous parts (computation, tracking) triggered *by* the network interactions.\n\n**1. Agents (Simplified Values):**\n\n*   **`SignalAgent\u003cT\u003e`:**\n    *   **Value:** `{ current: T }` (The raw value)\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `value_out!`: **Principal Port**. Represents the signal\u0027s identity and source for notifications. Connected *to* duplication trees.\n        *   `update_in`: Auxiliary port for receiving update commands.\n\n*   **`MapAgent\u003cT\u003e`:**\n    *   **Value:** `{ computeFn: () \u003d\u003e T, dependencies: Set\u003cAgentRef\u003e, cachedValue: T, dirty: boolean }` (Keep track of JS function, dependencies, cache)\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `value_out!`: **Principal Port**. Represents the computed value stream. Connects *to* downstream duplication trees.\n        *   `trigger_in`: Auxiliary port. Receives notifications *from* upstream dependency trees.\n\n*   **`EffectAgent`:**\n    *   **Value:** `{ effectFn: () \u003d\u003e void, dependencies: Set\u003cAgentRef\u003e }`\n    *   **Ports:**\n        *   `trigger_in!`: **Principal Port**. Receives notifications *from* upstream dependency trees.\n\n*   **`DupAgent`:** (Standard interaction net duplicator)\n    *   **Value:** (None needed, purely structural)\n    *   **Ports:** `in!`, `out1`, `out2`.\n\n**2. Connections \u0026 Duplication Trees:**\n\n*   The dependency graph is explicitly represented by **persistent connections** forming **duplication trees**.\n*   Example: Signal `S` used by Map `M1` and Effect `E1`.\n    *   Structure: `S(value_out!) \u003c-\u003e Dup1(in!)`, `Dup1(out1) \u003c-\u003e M1(trigger_in)`, `Dup1(out2) \u003c-\u003e E1(trigger_in!)`.\n*   When a dependency is added/removed (detected during synchronous tracking), specific agents/rules must manage adding/removing branches to/from these `DupAgent` trees.\n\n**3. Core Operations \u0026 Triggering Rules:**\n\n*   **Initialization (`createSignal`, `createMemo`, `createEffect`):**\n    *   These functions run *outside* a network reduction cycle initially.\n    *   They create the respective Agents (`SignalAgent`, `MapAgent`, `EffectAgent`).\n    *   `createMemo` and `createEffect` perform an initial **synchronous** run of their functions using a standard JS reactive tracking context (like Solid\u0027s) to identify initial dependencies.\n    *   Based on dependencies, they interact with the Annette network to **build the initial `DupAgent` connection trees**. This likely involves specific `ConnectDependencyAgent` interactions managed by a central graph management part of the library.\n\n*   **Updating a Signal (`signal.set(newValue)`):**\n    1.  User calls `set`.\n    2.  Compare `newValue` with `signalAgent.value.current`. If different:\n        *   Update `signalAgent.value.current`.\n        *   Create `NotifyAgent()`.\n        *   `network.connect(notifyAgent, signalAgent.value_out)`.\n        *   Call `network.reduce()`. **\u003c-- Network takes over**\n\n*   **Network Reduction - Propagation:**\n    1.  **Rule: `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e DupAgent`:**\n        *   Creates two `NotifyAgent`s.\n        *   Connects them to `dupAgent.out1` and `dupAgent.out2`.\n        *   Returns `[dupAgent]` (Consume original `NotifyAgent`, keep `DupAgent`).\n    2.  **Rule: `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e MapAgent` (via `trigger_in`):**\n        *   If `!mapAgent.value.dirty`:\n            *   Set `mapAgent.value.dirty \u003d true`.\n            *   Create `NotifyAgent()`.\n            *   `network.connect(notifyAgent, mapAgent.value_out)`. // Propagate downstream\n        *   Return `[mapAgent]` (Consume `NotifyAgent`, keep `MapAgent`).\n    3.  **Rule: `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e EffectAgent` (via `trigger_in`):**\n        *   **Schedule Effect:** Add the `effectAgent` to a queue of effects to run *after* the current `reduce()` cycle finishes.\n        *   Return `[effectAgent]` (Consume `NotifyAgent`, keep `EffectAgent`).\n\n*   **Post-Reduction - Effect Execution:**\n    1.  After `network.reduce()` completes, the library checks the effect queue.\n    2.  For each `effectAgent` in the queue:\n        *   Perform **synchronous** run:\n            *   Start tracking context.\n            *   Execute `effectAgent.value.effectFn()`.\n            *   Stop tracking context, get `newDependencies`.\n        *   Compare `newDependencies` with `effectAgent.value.dependencies`.\n        *   Update `effectAgent.value.dependencies \u003d newDependencies`.\n        *   **Queue Connection Changes:** For added/removed dependencies, queue requests (e.g., `QueueConnect(effectAgent, signalAgent)`, `QueueDisconnect(effectAgent, oldSignalAgent)`) to modify the `DupAgent` trees in the *next* `reduce` cycle.\n\n*   **Reading a Memo/Computed (`memo()`):**\n    1.  User calls `memo()`.\n    2.  Check `mapAgent.value.dirty`.\n    3.  If dirty:\n        *   Perform **synchronous** run:\n            *   Start tracking context.\n            *   Execute `mapAgent.value.computeFn()`. Get `newValue`.\n            *   Stop tracking context, get `newDependencies`.\n        *   Compare `newValue` with `mapAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n        *   Update `mapAgent.value.cachedValue \u003d newValue`.\n        *   Set `mapAgent.value.dirty \u003d false`.\n        *   Compare `newDependencies` with `mapAgent.value.dependencies`.\n        *   Update `mapAgent.value.dependencies \u003d newDependencies`.\n        *   **Queue Connection Changes:** As with effects.\n    4.  Return `mapAgent.value.cachedValue`.\n\n*   **Processing Connection Changes (Next `reduce()` cycle):**\n    *   Introduce temporary agents like `ConnectDependencyAgent(dependent, dependency)` and `DisconnectDependencyAgent(dependent, dependency)`.\n    *   These agents interact with the `value_out` ports of signals and potentially dedicated management ports on `DupAgent`s to rewire the duplication trees. Their rules would handle the logic of adding/removing branches and collapsing/expanding `DupAgent` structures.\n\n**Refined Architecture Summary:**\n\n1.  **Annette Manages:**\n    *   The reactive graph structure (Agents + Connections + Dup Trees).\n    *   Propagation of \"dirty\" notifications (`NotifyAgent`) through the graph via local interactions.\n    *   Structural updates to the dependency graph (connecting/disconnecting via dedicated rules).\n2.  **JavaScript Manages:**\n    *   Storing actual values and computation/effect functions (`agent.value`).\n    *   **Synchronous** execution of computations (`map`) and effects (`effect`).\n    *   **Synchronous** dependency tracking during these executions.\n    *   Scheduling effects to run *after* network stabilization.\n    *   Queueing structural graph changes identified during sync execution.\n3.  **Interaction:** JS logic queues network operations (notify, connect, disconnect). `network.reduce()` processes these operations and triggers schedulers (effect queue). Schedulers run JS logic, which might queue more network ops.\n\n**Elegance \u0026 Trade-offs:**\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   Achieves Solid-like synchronous reads and execution semantics for the user.\n    *   Leverages Annette\u0027s graph representation and local interaction for notification propagation.\n    *   Cleaner separation of concerns: Annette handles graph topology and event flow; JS handles the computation logic.\n    *   Avoids the complex asynchronous read problem within rules.\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   Less \"pure\" interaction net implementation; computation happens outside the reduction rules.\n    *   Requires careful management of the queue between JS execution and network reduction.\n    *   Complexity shifts to managing the `DupAgent` trees via rules.\n\nThis hybrid model seems like the most viable path to achieving the *behavior* of a library like SolidJS using Annette. It respects the strengths and limitations of both the interaction net model and standard synchronous JavaScript execution. The \"elegance\" comes from using each system for its most suitable task.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process for reviewing and refining the hybrid Annette/JS reactivity model:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** Build a SolidJS-like reactive library *using* Annette. The key Solid features are fine-grained reactivity, automatic dependency tracking, synchronous execution of reads/computations, and efficient updates. The goal is elegance and leveraging Annette\u0027s strengths where possible.\n\n2.  **Recap the Hybrid Model:**\n    *   Annette: Graph structure (Agents, Connections, Dup Trees), Notification Propagation (`NotifyAgent`), Structural Updates (managing Dup Trees).\n    *   JS: State storage (`agent.value`), Synchronous function execution (compute/effect), Synchronous dependency tracking, Effect scheduling (post-`reduce`), Queueing graph changes.\n    *   Core Loop: JS -\u003e `network.connect` (notify/update) -\u003e `network.reduce` -\u003e JS (effect queue) -\u003e JS (queue graph changes) -\u003e `network.connect` (connect/disconnect) -\u003e `network.reduce`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Against \"Elegance\" and Annette Principles:**\n    *   **Is it leveraging Annette?** Yes, for the graph structure and propagation. The `DupAgent` and `NotifyAgent` interactions feel idiomatic for interaction nets handling fan-out and events.\n    *   **Is it simple?** Compared to forcing *all* logic into rules, yes. Compared to native SolidJS, it\u0027s more complex due to the two-system coordination.\n    *   **Does it avoid previous hurdles?** Yes, the \"synchronous read within a rule\" problem is bypassed by moving computation/effect execution to JS.\n    *   **Is it pure Annette?** No. This is the main compromise. Significant logic runs outside the `reduce` cycle.\n\n4.  **Identify Remaining Hurdles/Complexities in the Hybrid Model:**\n    *   **DupAgent Tree Management:** This is now the central *structural* complexity. Adding/removing dependencies requires potentially complex rules to modify the `DupAgent` trees correctly (inserting, removing, collapsing redundant Dips). This needs well-defined rules and potentially dedicated agents.\n    *   **Coordination Overhead:** The back-and-forth between JS execution, queueing network ops, running `reduce`, processing effect queues, queueing more ops... This coordination layer adds inherent complexity and potential for subtle bugs. Is it truly more elegant than the initial, more complex \"pure\" Annette attempt? Maybe not *internally*, but potentially *externally* (user API).\n    *   **Initial Graph Build:** Building the *initial* Dup trees requires network interactions triggered from JS, adding to setup complexity.\n    *   **Atomicity:** Are updates truly atomic? The `reduce` cycle processes notifications. Effects run *after*. If an effect modifies another signal *during* the effect run, how does that integrate? Does it trigger a new `reduce` cycle immediately? This needs careful definition. Solid handles this via batching/transactional updates.\n    *   **`ReadRequestAgent` Complexity:** The previous model had a `ReadRequestAgent` for lazy memos. The hybrid model does lazy reads directly in JS (`memo()`). This is simpler *but* requires the JS code calling `memo()` to have access to the `MapAgent` instance. How is this passed around? (Likely the `createMemo` function returns a function that closes over the `MapAgent`).\n\n5.  **Refinement Ideas - Addressing Hurdles:**\n\n    *   **Simplify Dup Tree Management:**\n        *   Could we abstract this? Maybe a `SubscriptionManagerAgent` per signal? When a dependent subscribes/unsubscribes, it sends a message (`SubscribeAgent(dependent)`, `UnsubscribeAgent(dependent)`) to this manager.\n        *   The `SubscriptionManagerAgent` maintains the list of subscribers *within its value*.\n        *   When the `SignalAgent` is updated and connects `NotifyAgent` to `value_out!`, the first interaction is `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SubscriptionManagerAgent`.\n        *   This rule then iterates through the subscribers (in its `value`) and creates/connects *new* `NotifyAgent`s directly to each subscriber\u0027s `trigger_in` port.\n        *   *Benefit:* Eliminates the complex `DupAgent` trees and their structural management rules. Shifts complexity to iterating within a rule (potentially less efficient if many subscribers?) and managing the manager agent itself.\n        *   *Downside:* Feels less like pure graph manipulation. Less \"interaction netty\"? Requires the rule to access and iterate over data (`subscribers`) stored in an agent\u0027s `value`.\n\n    *   **Improve Coordination:**\n        *   Can we reduce the back-and-forth? Maybe effects/computations triggered by `NotifyAgent` interactions can *directly* queue network operations (connect/disconnect) without waiting for the end of the `reduce` cycle? Does Annette support modifying the active connection/agent set *during* a reduction based on rule outputs? (The spec suggests rules return new agents/connections, implying it happens *after* the interaction). If not possible, the queueing mechanism seems necessary.\n\n    *   **Clarify Atomicity/Batching:**\n        *   SolidJS typically batches updates within a \"tick\" or microtask. We need a similar concept.\n        *   Introduce a global \"batching\" flag.\n        *   When `signal.set` is called, if not batching, start batching, queue the update, schedule a microtask to `runBatch`.\n        *   If already batching, just queue the update.\n        *   `runBatch`:\n            1.  Process all queued signal updates (generate `NotifyAgent` connections).\n            2.  Call `network.reduce()` until stable.\n            3.  Run the effect queue (synchronously). Any *new* signal sets triggered here re-queue and restart the `runBatch` microtask loop *or* are handled transactionally within the current effect run if the library supports it.\n            4.  Process queued connection changes (generate `Connect/DisconnectDependencyAgent` connections).\n            5.  Call `network.reduce()` again to apply structural changes.\n            6.  Finish batching.\n        *   This formalizes the coordination and addresses atomicity.\n\n    *   **Revisit Lazy Memo Read:** The JS `memo()` function calling `mapAgent.value.computeFn()` directly seems okay and avoids network complexity for reads. The key is that the `computeFn` *must* have access to the correct `readSignal` function from the library context to ensure tracking happens.\n\n6.  **Final Proposed Refinement (Integrating Ideas):**\n\n    *   **Use `SubscriptionManagerAgent`:** Simplify propagation by removing `DupAgent` trees for dependencies. Each `SignalAgent`/`MapAgent` connects its `value_out!` to a dedicated `SubscriptionManagerAgent(in!)`. Dependents send `Subscribe/UnsubscribeAgent` messages to the manager. `NotifyAgent` interaction with the manager creates direct notifications to subscribers.\n    *   **Maintain Hybrid Execution:** Keep computation/effect logic in JS, triggered by network interactions but running synchronously outside the `reduce` cycle.\n    *   **Implement Batching:** Introduce explicit batching (microtask-based) to manage the update cycle, ensure atomicity, and correctly order propagation, effect execution, and structural updates.\n    *   **Lazy Memo Reads in JS:** Confirm this is acceptable; the `memo()` function needs library context for tracking.\n    *   **Structural Updates:** Use `Connect/DisconnectDependencyAgent` messages processed during the batched update cycle to tell `SubscriptionManagerAgent`s to update their internal subscriber lists.\n\n7.  **Self-Correction/Final Check:** Does this refined model still feel like it\u0027s \"using Annette\"? Yes, the graph structure and event propagation (`NotifyAgent`, `SubscribeAgent`, etc.) are handled via Annette interactions. The *computation* logic is externalized for practicality, similar to how many systems use a core engine plus external scripting. The batching mechanism is standard for reactive systems. The `SubscriptionManagerAgent` simplifies the graph structure significantly compared to complex `DupAgent` trees. This feels like a better balance.",

Modifying these trees (inserting/removing nodes/branches) via local interaction rules is non-trivial and prone to edge cases. While idiomatic for interaction nets, it might obscure the reactive logic.\n2.  **Coordination Overhead:** The multi-step process (notify-\u003ereduce-\u003eeffect-\u003equeue-\u003ereduce) works but feels indirect.\n3.  **Atomicity/Batching:** Solved by introducing an explicit batching mechanism around the coordination loop, mimicking standard reactive library practice.

Let\u0027s flesh this out:\n\n**Revised Agent/Port Structure:**\n\n*   **`SignalAgent\u003cT\u003e`:**\n    *   Value: `{ current: T }`\n    *   Ports: `update_in`, `manage_subs!` (Principal Port)\n\n*   **`MapAgent\u003cT\u003e`:**\n    *   Value: `{ computeFn: () \u003d\u003e T, dependencies: Set\u003cAgentRef\u003e, cachedValue: T, dirty: boolean, managerAgent: SubscriptionManagerAgent }` (Holds ref to its *own* manager)\n    *   Ports: `trigger_in`, `manage_subs!` (Principal Port)\n\n*   **`EffectAgent`:**\n    *   Value: `{ effectFn: () \u003d\u003e void, dependencies: Set\u003cAgentRef\u003e }`\n    *   Ports: `trigger_in!` (Principal Port - effects don\u0027t need downstream subscribers)\n\n*   **`SubscriptionManagerAgent`:** (One per Signal/Map)\n    *   Value: `{ subscribers: Set\u003cAgentRef\u003e }` (Refs to `MapAgent.trigger_in` or `EffectAgent.trigger_in` ports/agents)\n    *   Ports: `in!` (Principal Port - receives messages), `source_value` (Connects back to the `Signal/Map.manage_subs` port it manages?)\n\n*   **Temporary \"Message\" Agents:**\n    *   `UpdateAgent(newValue)`\n    *   `NotifyAgent()`\n    *   `SubscribeAgent(subscriberRef)`\n    *   `UnsubscribeAgent(subscriberRef)`\n\n**Revised Flow:**\n\n1.  **Initialization (`createSignal`, `createMemo`, `createEffect`):**\n    *   Create the main agent (`Signal`, `Map`, `Effect`).\n    *   If `Signal` or `Map`, also create its dedicated `SubscriptionManagerAgent`.

Replaces complex, hard-to-manage `DupAgent` trees with simpler message passing (`Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe`) to dedicated managers. The graph structure is less cluttered.\n*   **Annette Usage:** Still uses Annette for graph structure, message passing (notifications, sub/unsub), and driving the update cycle via `reduce`. Rules are simpler (mostly message handling or basic state changes).\n*   **Performance:** Potentially trades the structural complexity of Dup trees for the runtime overhead of iterating subscriber lists within the `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SubscriptionManagerAgent` rule and creating many `NotifyAgent` instances. The performance impact depends heavily on Annette\u0027s rule execution and agent creation/destruction efficiency.\n*   **Coordination:** The batching mechanism remains necessary, but the steps within the batch are clearer.\n*   **Purity:** Still a hybrid model, but the Annette part focuses more on event/message dispatch rather than complex structural rewrites for dependencies.\n\n**Remaining Considerations:**\n\n*   **Rule-based Iteration:** Can an Annette rule efficiently iterate over a `Set` stored in `agent.value` and create multiple new connections? If not, this model breaks down. We assume it\u0027s possible.\n*   **Agent References (`AgentRef`):** How are agents/ports referenced reliably in messages (`SubscribeAgent`) and subscriber lists, especially if agents can be consumed and replaced (though in this model, core agents are persistent)? Need stable identifiers or a reliable referencing mechanism.\n*   **Cleanup:** When an effect or memo is disposed of, it needs to send `UnsubscribeAgent` messages to all its dependencies\u0027 managers.\n\n**Conclusion on Refinement:**\n\nThis latest refinement using `SubscriptionManagerAgent`s appears to be the most promising blend of SolidJS-like behavior and Annette\u0027s interaction model. It significantly simplifies the graph structure compared to `DupAgent` trees, making dependency management cleaner. The core trade-off is potentially moving some workload from graph structure manipulation into rule-based iteration and message creation. This seems like a worthwhile trade-off for overall architectural elegance and maintainability, assuming Annette\u0027s rule engine can handle the iteration efficiently. The hybrid execution model with explicit batching remains the most practical way to achieve the desired synchronous semantics.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process to arrive at the conclusion about `DupAgent` trees versus other approaches for fan-out in the context of Annette:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The fundamental issue is fan-out. When a `SignalAgent` (or `MapAgent`) changes or needs to notify dependents, its `value_out` port represents the source of this notification. However, multiple `MapAgent`s and `EffectAgent`s might depend on this single source. How does the notification, originating from one port, reach *all* dependents connected to it?\n\n2.  **Analyze Annette\u0027s Primitives (as presented):**\n    *   **Agents:** Hold state/identity.\n    *   **Ports:** Connection points. Principal port (`!`) seems key for interactions.\n    *   **Connections:** Link two ports. The examples and descriptions *imply* a 1-to-1 connection between ports. `connect(a, b)` links `a` and `b`. It doesn\u0027t naturally suggest `connect(a, b)` *and* `connect(a, c)` simultaneously on the *same port `a`*. The `Programming with Interaction Nets` paper also shows 1-to-1 connections in examples.\n    *   **Rules:** Triggered by connection between *two* specific (principal?) ports. `rule A(port!) B(port!) { ... }`. Rules consume the interacting agents/ports and produce new ones.\n    *   **`reduce()`:** Processes *one* interaction (or potentially multiple non-interfering ones) at a time based on existing connections matching rules.\n\n3.  **Consider Fan-out Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1: Annette Allows 1-to-Many Connections on a Port:** If a single port (e.g., `signal.value_out!`) *can* be directly connected to multiple other ports (`map1.trigger_in`, `map2.trigger_in`, `effect1.trigger_in`), then fan-out is trivial. When `NotifyAgent` connects to `signal.value_out!`, the `reduce` mechanism would somehow have to recognize *all* connected partners and trigger rules for each pair (`NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e Map1`, `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e Map2`, `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e Effect1`).\n        *   *Critique:* This contradicts the apparent 1-to-1 nature of connections and the local nature of interaction rules (acting on *one* pair). How would the `NotifyAgent` be consumed? Would it be consumed by the first interaction, preventing others? Would it need to be duplicated somehow implicitly? This seems unlikely given the model\u0027s description. The provided Annette code (`src/connection.ts`, `src/network.ts`) doesn\u0027t explicitly forbid or support this, but the interaction model itself leans towards pairwise interactions. The `Graph` type in `network.ts` (`Map\u003cA, C[]\u003e`) stores a list of connections *originating from* agent `A`, but this doesn\u0027t necessarily mean multiple connections on the *same port*.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Annette Requires 1-to-1 Port Connections (Most Likely Assumption):** If a port can only participate in *one* connection at a time, we need an explicit mechanism to distribute a signal to multiple destinations.\n        *   *Option 2a: Iteration within a Rule:* A `NotifyAgent` interacts with a `SubscriptionManagerAgent`. The rule *iterates* through the subscriber list and creates *new* `NotifyAgent`s and *new* connections for each subscriber.\n            *   *Critique:* This was the \"Subscription Manager\" refinement. It relies on the rule engine being able to perform iteration and multiple `connect` operations within a single rule execution. This adds imperative logic *inside* the rule, moving away from purely declarative graph rewriting. It\u0027s plausible but depends heavily on Annette\u0027s specific capabilities.\n        *   **Option 2b: Explicit Graph Structure for Duplication:** Use dedicated agents whose *sole purpose* is duplication, following the principles shown in the `Programming with Interaction Nets` paper (like `natDup`). This is the `DupAgent` approach. A `NotifyAgent` interacts with the root `DupAgent`, which triggers a cascade of interactions down the tree, ultimately producing one `NotifyAgent` at each leaf connected to a dependent.\n            *   *Critique:* This maintains the purely structural, local interaction model. Computation (duplication) happens via graph rewriting. However, it creates complex static graph structures (`DupAgent` trees) that need dynamic management (adding/removing branches when dependencies change).\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate the `Programming with Interaction Nets` Paper:** Section 10 explicitly introduces `natDup` which has *one* input (`target!`) and *two* outputs (`first`, `second`). It duplicates a `Nat` structure. This demonstrates that:\n    *   Interaction nets *do* have explicit duplication constructs.\n    *   These duplicators are implemented as agents with specific interaction rules.\n    *   They are necessary when a single value needs to be used in multiple places, respecting linearity (or simulating non-linearity).\n\n5.  **Apply to the Reactive Problem:** In the reactive signals context, a signal\u0027s value (or notification) *is* conceptually used in multiple places (by multiple dependents). To model this within the interaction net paradigm, especially if preserving the local, structural rewrite nature, an explicit duplication mechanism analogous to `natDup` seems necessary. The `DupAgent` serves precisely this role for notifications or shared values.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the principles of interaction nets (local interactions, graph rewriting) and the provided examples (explicit `natDup`), the most *idiomatic* way to handle fan-out within a pure interaction net model is likely through explicit duplication agents (`DupAgent` trees). The \"Subscription Manager\" approach is a valid alternative *if* Annette\u0027s rule engine supports the necessary iteration and connection logic within a single rule, effectively abstracting the fan-out *into* the rule\u0027s imperative code rather than the graph structure. However, the `DupAgent` approach aligns more closely with the foundational concepts presented in interaction net literature.\n\n7.  **Self-Correction:** My previous refinement leaned towards the Subscription Manager for \"elegance\" by reducing *visible* graph complexity. However, that elegance comes at the cost of potentially complex rule logic and assumptions about the rule engine\u0027s capabilities. The `DupAgent` approach, while structurally more complex, might be more faithful to the core interaction net model and potentially more analyzable within that framework. Therefore, asserting the *need* for `DupAgent` trees seems justified *if the goal is to adhere strictly to the interaction net computational model*. If the goal is simply to *use* Annette as a substrate and allow more imperative logic in rules, the Subscription Manager is a valid, potentially simpler alternative. The choice depends on the desired level of adherence to the pure interaction net philosophy versus pragmatic implementation convenience. Given the prompt asks to *use Annette*, understanding its core model suggests DupAgents are the canonical solution for fan-out.",

      "text": "You are absolutely right to push back and question the necessity of `DupAgent` trees. My apologies for getting overly attached to that specific interaction net pattern without fully considering Annette\u0027s specific implementation details or potential alternatives. Let\u0027s re-examine based *only* on the provided Annette code and concepts.\n\n**Revisiting the Annette Code:**\n\n1.  **`src/network.ts` - `Graph` type:**\n    ```typescript\n    type Graph\u003c\n      A extends IAgent\u003cany, any, any, any\u003e \u003d IAgent,\n      C extends IConnection[] \u003d IConnection\u003cstring, A\u003e[],\n    \u003e \u003d Map\u003cA, C | IConnection[]\u003e;\n    ```\n    This `Graph` type stores, for each source agent `A`, an array (`C[]`) of its outgoing connections. This **strongly suggests** that a single agent *can* be the source of multiple connections. It doesn\u0027t explicitly state if multiple connections can originate from the *same port*, but it definitely allows an agent to connect to multiple other agents.\n\n2.  **`src/connection.ts` - `Connection` function:**\n    The function signatures create a single connection between two agents (or ports). There\u0027s no inherent limitation preventing multiple calls like:\n    ```typescript\n    net.connect(signalAgent, mapAgent1);\n    net.connect(signalAgent, effectAgent1);\n    ```\n    Assuming these connect the default `main` ports (or specified ports), this implies multiple connections *can* originate from the same agent, potentially even the same port.\n\n3.  **`src/network.ts` - `reduce()` and `step()`:** These are currently stubs (`return;`). The actual interaction logic isn\u0027t implemented. This leaves open how multiple connections involving the same agent/port would be handled.\n\n4.  **`src/rule.ts` - `IRule`:** A rule is defined based on a specific `connection` between two agents.\n\n**Rethinking Fan-Out Without Duplicators:**\n\nGiven that an agent can be the source of multiple connections stored in the `Graph`, let\u0027s revisit how fan-out could work *without* explicit `DupAgent` trees:\n\n*   **Scenario:** `SignalAgent` `S` needs to notify `MapAgent` `M` and `EffectAgent` `E`. The network contains connections `C1 \u003d connect(S, M)` and `C2 \u003d connect(S, E)` (likely using the principal/main ports).\n*   **Trigger:** `update(S, newValue)` eventually leads to `connect(NotifyAgent(), S.ports.main)`. Let\u0027s call this connection `C_Notify`.\n*   **The `reduce()` cycle:** How does the `reduce` function process interactions?\n    *   **Option 1: Pairwise Matching:** It iterates through all active connections. It finds `C_Notify`. It sees `NotifyAgent` connected to `S`. Does a rule `Rule(NotifyAgent, S)` exist? If so, it fires. This rule would need to know about `S`\u0027s *other* connections (`C1`, `C2`) to propagate the notification. It could perhaps access `network.connections.get(S)` to find all connections originating from `S`, filter them (e.g., find connections *not* involving `NotifyAgent`), and then create *new* `NotifyAgent`s directed towards `M` and `E`.\n        ```typescript\n        // Hypothetical Rule(NotifyAgent, SignalAgent) action\n        (notify, signal) \u003d\u003e {\n            const network \u003d getNetworkContext(); // Assume we can get network access\n            const outgoingConnections \u003d network.connections.get(signal) || [];\n            const dependents \u003d outgoingConnections.filter(conn \u003d\u003e !(conn.destination instanceof NotifyAgent)); // Simplistic filter\n\n            const newAgentsAndConnections \u003d [];\n            for (const depConn of dependents) {\n                const newNotify \u003d NotifyAgent();\n                // Need a way to connect the newNotify to the *dependent\u0027s* input port\n                // This might involve creating a temporary connection OR directly targeting the port\n                // Option: connect newNotify to depConn.destination\u0027s trigger_in port\n                const targetPort \u003d depConn.destination.ports.trigger_in; // Assuming standard port name\n                if (targetPort) {\n                   newAgentsAndConnections.push(newNotify);\n                   // Problem: how to represent the connection to targetPort?\n                   // Maybe rules return [agentToKeep, agentToKeep, newConnection1, newConnection2]?\n                   // OR maybe the rule directly manipulates the network graph (less pure)\n                }\n            }\n            // Return signal to keep it, plus any new agents/connections\n            return [signal, ...newAgentsAndConnections];\n        }\n        ```\n        This requires rules to have network access and becomes quite complex, blurring the lines of local interaction.\n\n    *   **Option 2: Port-Centric Interaction:** Maybe `reduce` doesn\u0027t just look at agent pairs, but specifically at connected *ports*. When `NotifyAgent` connects to `S.ports.main`, the `reduce` mechanism sees *all* connections currently involving `S.ports.main`. If `S.ports.main` is also connected to `M.ports.trigger_in` and `E.ports.trigger_in`, the system needs a way to resolve this. Perhaps the `NotifyAgent` interaction *replaces* `S` temporarily with something that then interacts individually with `M` and `E`? This feels like reintroducing duplication implicitly.\n\n    *   **Option 3 (Most Plausible based on Code Structure): Intelligent `reduce()` / Rule Matching:** The `reduce` loop iterates through active connections. When it finds `C_Notify` (`NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e S`), it looks for a matching rule `Rule(NotifyAgent, S)`. When it finds `C1` (`S \u003c-\u003e M`), it looks for `Rule(S, M)`. The key is what happens when a rule *fires*. If `Rule(NotifyAgent, S)` fires and *returns* `S` along with new `NotifyAgent`s intended for `M` and `E`, how are those new agents connected?\n        If the rule `Rule(NotifyAgent, S)` simply *signals* dirtiness *without* consuming the `NotifyAgent`, and then the `reduce` continues, it might later find `Rule(S, M)` and `Rule(S, E)`. But these rules are for `S` interacting, not for propagating a notification *through* `S`.\n\n**Conclusion Re-Revised:**\n\nYou are right to question the *necessity* based *purely* on the library\u0027s code structure allowing multiple outgoing connections per agent. The `Graph` type permits it.\n\n**However, the *interaction model* itself still presents the fan-out challenge.** How does a single interaction event (like `NotifyAgent` arriving at `S`) trigger multiple subsequent, independent events (notifications arriving at `M` and `E`) while respecting the local, pairwise nature of rules?\n\n1.  **If Annette\u0027s (unimplemented) `reduce` allows rules to access the network state and create multiple new, arbitrary connections**, then the \"Subscription Manager\" or \"Rule-based iteration\" approach is viable without `DupAgent`s. This makes the rules more complex but keeps the static graph simpler.\n2.  **If Annette\u0027s `reduce` strictly adheres to local replacement based on the two interacting agents/ports**, then distributing a single notification requires *some* mechanism for duplication. `DupAgent` trees are the explicit, structural way shown in interaction net literature. Implicit duplication would need to be built into the `reduce` logic itself when handling a 1-to-many port connection scenario.\n\n**Refined Stance:**\n\nWhile the Annette *data structures* (`Graph`) allow for multiple outgoing connections, the *dynamics* of propagating a single event to multiple dependents via local, pairwise interaction rules remains the core issue. **Explicit `DupAgent` trees are the most straightforward way to achieve this fan-out *using only the established interaction net primitives* (agents, ports, 1-to-1 connections, local rules).** If Annette\u0027s `reduce` implementation or rule execution environment provides more powerful features (network access within rules, implicit fan-out handling), then `DupAgent` trees *might* not be strictly necessary, but the alternative involves putting more complex, imperative logic into the rules or the `reduce` function itself.\n\nTherefore, the need for `DupAgent` trees depends on the specific semantics of Annette\u0027s `reduce` and rule execution, which are currently undefined in the provided code. Assuming a strict interpretation of local, pairwise interactions, duplication structures are the canonical solution.",

The static graph directly represents dependencies. Fan-out is handled elegantly within a single rule by leveraging the assumed network access. No need for complex structural agents like `DupAgent` or `SubscriptionManagerAgent`.\n*   **Annette Usage:** Leverages the graph structure and rule-based reduction for event propagation. Rules become slightly more complex due to network awareness but handle a core mechanism (fan-out) cleanly.\n*   **Performance:** Likely better than the previous models, as it avoids the overhead of managing intermediate agents (`DupAgent`, `SubscriptionManager`) and potentially reduces the number of rule firings needed for fan-out. Performance depends on the efficiency of network lookups within rules and the core `reduce` loop.\n*   **Coordination:** Batching remains essential for atomicity and scheduling JS execution relative to network reduction. The loop might involve fewer `reduce` calls per batch if connection changes are handled efficiently.\n*   **Purity:** Rules are less \"purely local\" as they access network state (`getNetworkContext`, finding connections). This is a necessary trade-off for this model\u0027s simplicity.\n\n**Conclusion on Refinement:**\n\nGiven the assumption that rules can access network state and return new connections, this model is significantly more elegant and direct than the previous attempts. It maps reactive concepts cleanly onto Annette\u0027s agents and connections, using rules primarily for propagating events and triggering external JS logic. The complexity of explicit duplication structures is removed, resulting in a system that should be easier to understand and potentially more performant.

This offloads the complex parts unsuitable for purely local rules.\n    *   **Annette Rules:** Focused on:\n        *   Receiving updates (`UpdateAgent -\u003e SignalAgent`).\n        *   Propagating notifications (`NotifyAgent -\u003e SignalAgent` for fan-out, `NotifyAgent -\u003e MapAgent` for chaining).\n        *   Triggering effects (`NotifyAgent -\u003e EffectAgent`).\n    *   **Coordination:** Batching mechanism (`runBatch`) orchestrates JS execution and network reduction cycles.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Strengths (Elegance Check):**\n    *   **Simplicity of Static Graph:** The direct connection model is much easier to visualize and reason about than `DupAgent` trees or `SubscriptionManagerAgent` indirections. Big win for elegance.\n    *   **Clear Separation:** Annette handles the graph structure and the *propagation* of change signals. JS handles the *computation* and *tracking* based on those signals. This feels like a good separation of concerns.\n    *   **Directness:** Interactions feel more direct. An update leads to notifications, which lead to effects or marking memos dirty.\n    *   **Reduced Agent Types:** Fewer core agent types are needed compared to previous iterations.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Weaknesses/Challenges (Reality Check):**\n    *   **The Core Assumption:** This is the biggest dependency. If Annette\u0027s `reduce` *doesn\u0027t* work this way, the model needs a major rework (likely back towards managers or duplicators).\n    *   **Network Access in Rules:** This breaks the pure local interaction concept fundamental to *classical* interaction nets. Is this acceptable within the goals of Annette? It makes rules less self-contained and potentially harder to reason about in isolation. Performance implications? How is `getNetworkContext()` implemented?\n    *   **Rule Complexity (Fan-out Rule):** The `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent` rule now has significant responsibility: finding all dependents and creating multiple new agents/connections. While conceptually clean, the implementation detail needs care.\n    *   **Dependency Graph Updates:** How are connections *reliably* added and removed when dependencies change? The proposal mentions queueing connection changes. This needs robust handling, potentially involving dedicated rules (`AddConnectionRule`, `RemoveConnectionRule`?) or careful management within the batching cycle to ensure consistency *before* the next notification propagation. This part feels slightly underspecified. Does the JS logic create `Connection` objects and queue them? How does the network process a \"remove connection\" request?\n    *   **Performance of Network Lookups:** How efficient is `network.connections.get(signalAgent)` and iterating through connections within a rule? If the network is large, this could become a bottleneck.\n    *   **Garbage Collection:** While Annette might handle *agent* cleanup, JS objects held within `agent.value` (like closures for `computeFn`, `effectFn`, `cachedValue`) are still subject to standard JS GC. If agents are long-lived, this is standard, but worth noting.\n\n6.  **Refinement Opportunities:**\n    *   **Specify Connection Management:** Detail how adding/removing connections works. Should it be dedicated message agents (`AddConnectionAgent`, `RemoveConnectionAgent`) that interact with the ports involved? Or is there a direct `network.addConnection(conn)` / `network.removeConnection(conn)` API callable from the JS batching logic? The latter seems cleaner if available.\n    *   **Clarify Rule Context:** Define `getNetworkContext()` more clearly. Is it passed implicitly to the rule function?\n    *   **Consider Rule Granularity:** Could the fan-out logic be broken down further, or is having one \"smart\" rule acceptable? Keeping it in one rule centralizes the fan-out logic.\n    *   **Error Handling:** How are errors during computation or effect execution handled within this hybrid model?\n\n7.  **Overall Assessment:**\n    *   Assuming the core premise holds (network-aware rules), this design is significantly more elegant and practical for building a SolidJS-like library than the previous ones.\n    *   It strikes a good balance between leveraging Annette\u0027s graph capabilities and using JS for synchronous operations.\n    *   The main challenges shift from complex graph structures (`DupAgent`s) to the implementation details of network-aware rules, efficient connection management, and the coordination logic in the batching mechanism.\n    *   It feels like a viable, albeit potentially non-pure, application of interaction net concepts to reactive programming.\n\n8.  **Final Polish:** Rephrase the summary to emphasize the reliance on the assumption, highlight the elegance gained, and clearly state the remaining implementation challenges (network-aware rules, connection management).",

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s review the latest solution (Hybrid Model with Network Aware Rules) for building a SolidJS-like library using Annette.\n\n**Assumptions Recap:**\n\n1.  Rules can access network state (find connections of involved agents).\n2.  Rules can return new agents and *new connections* to be added/established by the `reduce` mechanism.\n3.  The network\u0027s `Graph` allows multiple connections to originate from a single agent/port.\n\n**Architecture Summary:**\n\n*   **Agents:** `SignalAgent`, `MapAgent`, `EffectAgent` represent reactive primitives. `UpdateAgent`, `NotifyAgent` are temporary messages.\n*   **Connections:** Direct `value_out` -\u003e `trigger_in` connections represent the dependency graph.\n*   **JS Runtime:** Handles synchronous execution (compute/effect), dependency tracking, batching, and queuing network operations.\n*   **Annette Runtime:** Manages the agent/connection graph, processes rules (`reduce`), and propagates `NotifyAgent` messages. Fan-out is handled within the `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent` rule by looking up dependents in the network graph.\n\n**Review Points:**\n\n1.  **Elegance \u0026 Simplicity:**\n    *   **Pro:** This model is significantly more elegant than those requiring explicit `DupAgent` trees or `SubscriptionManagerAgent`s. The static graph directly mirrors the conceptual dependency graph, which is intuitive.\n    *   **Pro:** The number of core agent types and rules is reduced, focusing rules on clear tasks: update reception, notification fan-out, triggering computations/effects.\n    *   **Con:** The elegance relies heavily on the power assumed for the rules (network access, connection creation). If these assumptions don\u0027t hold, the model breaks.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Annette:**\n    *   **Pro:** Effectively uses Annette\u0027s graph representation for the reactive structure.\n    *   **Pro:** Uses the interaction/reduction mechanism for propagating change notifications asynchronously.\n    *   **Con:** Deviates from strict local interaction purity by requiring rules to be network-aware. This might be a pragmatic choice for Annette\u0027s design goals but differs from classical interaction nets.\n\n3.  **Handling Reactivity Concepts:**\n    *   **Signals/Updates:** Cleanly handled via `UpdateAgent` and direct state modification.\n    *   **Notification Propagation:** The fan-out logic is now encapsulated within a single rule (`NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent`), which is conceptually clean, *assuming* the rule capabilities.\n    *   **Memos (Lazy Computation):** Handled synchronously in JS upon read, marking the agent dirty via network notifications. This is standard practice in reactive libs.\n    *   **Effects (Eager Execution):** Triggered by network notifications, but execution (and subsequent dependency tracking/connection changes) is handled synchronously in JS after the `reduce` cycle stabilizes. This seems like a robust approach.\n    *   **Dependency Tracking:** Correctly offloaded to synchronous JS execution phases (initialization, effect runs, memo reads).\n    *   **Dependency Graph Updates:** Identified in JS, queued, and presumably processed by Annette (either via direct API calls from JS or dedicated agents/rules). This interaction needs to be robust.\n\n4.  **Potential Hurdles \u0026 Refinements:**\n    *   **Network Access Implementation:** How `getNetworkContext()` works and its performance implications are critical unknowns. Is it efficient to query connections frequently within rules?\n    *   **Connection Management Detail:** The mechanism for adding/removing connections queued by the JS runtime needs concrete definition. Can the JS batching logic directly call `network.connect(conn)` / `network.disconnect(conn)`? Or does it require queueing `AddConnectionAgent`/`RemoveConnectionAgent` messages to be processed in the *next* `reduce` cycle? The former is simpler if the API allows mutation during the post-reduce phase.\n    *   **Rule vs. `reduce` Logic:** How much \"intelligence\" is in the rules versus the `reduce` function itself? If `reduce` implicitly handles fan-out when it sees a `NotifyAgent` connected to a port with multiple outgoing dependency connections, the `NotifyAgent \u003c-\u003e SignalAgent` rule could be simpler. But the current proposal puts the fan-out logic *in* the rule.\n    *   **Atomicity/Consistency:** The batching mechanism correctly addresses this, ensuring effects run only after propagation stabilizes. Ensuring queued connection changes are processed correctly before the *next* round of notifications is vital.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis \"Network Aware Rules\" model represents a very strong candidate architecture, *provided the underlying assumptions about Annette\u0027s capabilities are met*.\n\n*   **It\u0027s elegant:** The structure is clean and maps well to reactive concepts.\n*   **It\u0027s hybrid:** It pragmatically separates concerns, using JS sync execution for complex logic/tracking and Annette for graph management and event propagation.\n*   **It\u0027s plausible:** It avoids the major complexities of the previous models (Dup trees, complex managers).\n\n**Refinement Suggestion (Minor):**\n\nConsider if the connection management (adding/removing dependency links) is best handled by:\n    a) Direct network API calls from the JS batching logic after effects/memos run. (Simplest if possible).\n    b) Queueing specific `AddConnectionAgent`/`RemoveConnectionAgent` messages that interact with the relevant `value_out` and `trigger_in` ports via dedicated rules in the next `reduce` cycle. (More purely \"Annette-driven\" but adds another step).\n\nOption (a) seems preferable for simplicity if Annette allows graph modifications between `reduce` cycles initiated from outside the network rules.\n\n**Final Verdict:** This is the most promising direction. Its success hinges entirely on whether Annette is designed (or can be designed) with the assumed rule capabilities (network awareness, dynamic connection creation) and efficient connection querying. If so, it offers an elegant way to implement fine-grained reactivity using interaction net principles.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a breakdown of the thought process for implementing the `reduce` and `step` functions for Annette, based on the \"Network Aware Rules\" model and the library\u0027s existing structure:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal of `reduce` is to repeatedly apply interaction rules to connected agents until no more rules can fire (the network reaches a stable state, or quiescent point). `step` should perform *one* such interaction.\n\n2.  **Core Mechanism:** Interaction happens when two agents are connected, and a rule exists for that specific pair (or potentially, for the types/names of the connected agents). The rule dictates what happens â€“ usually consuming the interactors and potentially producing new agents/connections.\n\n3.  **Input Data Structures:** What information is needed to find interactions?\n    *   `network.agents`: Map of agents by name (useful for lookup, but not directly for finding interactions).\n    *   `network.connections`: `Map\u003cAgent, Connection[]\u003e` - This seems like the *primary* structure to iterate over. It tells us which agents are connected.\n    *   `network.rules`: `Map\u003cAgent, Map\u003cAgent, Rule\u003e\u003e` - This maps a source agent to a map of its destination agents and the corresponding rule. This is crucial for finding the *correct* rule for a given connection.\n\n4.  **`step()` - The Single Interaction:**\n    *   **Identify Potential Interactions:** We need to find *one* connection that matches an existing rule. The most straightforward way is to iterate through the `network.connections`.\n    *   **Iteration Strategy:** Iterate through the `Map` entries (`[sourceAgent, outgoingConnections]`). For each `sourceAgent`, iterate through its `outgoingConnections`.\n    *   **Rule Lookup:** For each `connection` (`sourceAgent` -\u003e `destinationAgent`), check if a rule exists in `network.rules`.\n        *   `sourceRules \u003d network.rules.get(connection.source)`\n        *   If `sourceRules` exists, `rule \u003d sourceRules.get(connection.destination)`\n        *   If `rule` exists, we\u0027ve found an interaction candidate!\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   Get the `action` function from the `rule`.\n        *   Execute the `action`. How? The `action` signature in `rule.ts` allows `(connection)`, `(source, destination)`, or `(sourceName, destinationName)`. The simplest to provide is `(source, destination)`.\n        *   `results \u003d rule.action(connection.source, connection.destination)`\n    *   **Processing Results:** The assumption is `results` is `void` or `(Agent | Connection)[]`.\n        *   **Remove Old Entities:** The interacting agents (`source`, `destination`) and the connection itself need to be removed *conceptually*. Since rules can return the agents to keep them, we should remove the *connection* that triggered the rule. We also need to remove the agents *if they are not returned* in the `results` array.\n        *   **Add New Entities:** Iterate through `results`.\n            *   If it\u0027s an `Agent`, ensure it\u0027s tracked in `network.agents`, `network.names`, `network.types`. (Need helper functions `_addAgent`, `_removeAgent`).\n            *   If it\u0027s a `Connection`, add it to `network.connections` using the existing `addConnectionToGraph` helper (or a refined version).\n    *   **State Management:** Need to carefully update `network.connections` and potentially `network.agents`. Removing connections while iterating requires care (e.g., collect changes and apply after iteration, or iterate over a copy).\n    *   **Return Value:** `step` should indicate if an interaction occurred (e.g., return `true` if a rule fired, `false` otherwise).\n    *   **Stopping:** `step` should stop after the *first* successful interaction it finds.\n\n5.  **`reduce()` - Repeated Steps:**\n    *   This is simpler conceptually: repeatedly call `step()` until it returns `false`.\n    *   Use a `while` loop: `while (step()) { /* loop */ }`.\n    *   Maybe add a maximum iteration count to prevent infinite loops in case of buggy rules.\n\n6.  **Refining `step()` - Handling Agent Removal and Connection Updates:**\n    *   Removing the triggering connection: This needs to be done carefully. If `network.connections` maps `Source -\u003e [Connections]`, we need to remove the specific connection object from that array. Also, need to consider the *reverse* connection if the graph stores bidirectional info (it doesn\u0027t seem to currently, but might be needed for efficient lookup). Let\u0027s assume unidirectional storage for now.\n    *   Removing agents: If an agent isn\u0027t returned by the rule, it\u0027s \"consumed\". We need to:\n        *   Remove it from `network.agents`, `network.names`, `network.types`.\n        *   Crucially, remove *all other connections* involving this agent (both where it\u0027s a source and where it\u0027s a destination). This requires iterating through the *entire* `network.connections` map, which is inefficient.\n    *   **Alternative: Active Connection Set:** Instead of iterating the whole graph structure repeatedly, maintain a separate `Set\u003cConnection\u003e` of potentially *active* connections (those whose agent pairs *might* have a rule). When agents are modified or connections change, update this active set. `step` iterates only this smaller set. This seems more efficient for sparse interactions. Let\u0027s stick to the simpler graph iteration first, then optimize if needed.\n\n7.  **Refining `step()` - Accessing Network Context in Rules:**\n    *   The assumption was rules need network access (`getNetworkContext`). How to provide this?\n        *   Pass `network` instance to the `action`: `rule.action(source, destination, network)`. This requires changing the `Action` type definition in `rule.ts`. Let\u0027s assume this is feasible.\n        *   Use a closure: Define rules *within* the network\u0027s scope so they implicitly have access (less clean).\n        *   Use a global context (generally bad practice).\n    *   **Decision:** Modifying the `Action` type to accept the network seems the most explicit and manageable approach.\n\n8.  **Refining `step()` - Handling Rule Return Values:**\n    *   The rule returns `void | (Agent | Connection)[]`.\n    *   We need to cleanly separate which returned agents are *new* and which are *kept*. A simple convention: if an agent returned is identical (`\u003d\u003d\u003d`) to one of the input agents, it\u0027s kept. Otherwise, it\u0027s new.\n    *   The logic becomes:\n        *   Identify `source` and `destination` agents.\n        *   Execute `action`.\n        *   Determine `agentsToKeep` (returned agents `\u003d\u003d\u003d` source or destination).\n        *   Determine `newAgents` (returned agents `!\u003d\u003d` source or destination).\n        *   Determine `newConnections` (returned connections).\n        *   Remove triggering connection.\n        *   Remove `source` if not in `agentsToKeep`.\n        *   Remove `destination` if not in `agentsToKeep`.\n        *   Add `newAgents`.\n        *   Add `newConnections`.\n\n9.  **Implementing Helper Functions:**\n    *   `_addAgent(agent)`: Adds to `agents`, `names`, `types`. Handles potential duplicates.\n    *   `_removeAgent(agent)`: Removes from `agents`, `names`, `types`. **Crucially, must also remove all connections involving this agent.** This is the expensive part.\n    *   `_addConnection(connection)`: Adds to the `connections` map.\n    *   `_removeConnection(connection)`: Removes from the `connections` map.\n\n10. **Addressing the Agent Removal Cascade:** Removing an agent requires cleaning up all its connections.\n    *   Iterate `network.connections`. For each `[source, connsList]`:\n        *   If `source \u003d\u003d\u003d agentToRemove`, remove the whole entry.\n        *   Filter `connsList` to remove any connection where `conn.destination \u003d\u003d\u003d agentToRemove`. If the list becomes empty, remove the entry for `source`.\n    *   This cleanup must happen *within* the `step` function after a rule consumes an agent.\n\n11. **Final Structure (`step`):**\n    *   Find an active connection + rule.\n    *   If none found, return `false`.\n    *   Execute `rule.action(source, dest, network)`.\n    *   Process results: identify kept agents, new agents, new connections.\n    *   `_removeConnection(triggeringConnection)`.\n    *   If `source` not kept, `_removeAgent(source)`.\n    *   If `dest` not kept, `_removeAgent(dest)`.\n    *   For `newAgent` in `newAgents`, `_addAgent(newAgent)`.\n    *   For `newConn` in `newConnections`, `_addConnection(newConn)`.\n    *   Return `true`.\n\n12. **Consider Port Specificity:** The current implementation assumes connections/rules are agent-to-agent (using default/main ports). The `Connection` type *does* store `sourcePort` and `destinationPort`. The rule lookup and matching *should* ideally consider these ports if the system needs that level of specificity. For now, let\u0027s assume agent-level rules for simplicity, matching the simpler `connect(agent, agent)` usage. If port-specific rules are needed, the `network.rules` structure and lookup logic would need refinement (e.g., `Map\u003cAgent, Map\u003cPortName, Map\u003cAgent, Map\u003cPortName, Rule\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e` - becomes complex quickly). Let\u0027s stick to Agent-to-Agent rules based on the default `connect`.\n\n\nThis detailed thought process covers identifying requirements, exploring options, handling state changes, and considering efficiency and API design, leading to the implemented code.",

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s revamp the internal representation and the `step`/`reduce` logic to explicitly handle multiple ports, improve stability (especially during iteration), and optimize for potentially faster rule lookups.\n\n**Core Ideas for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Port-Centric Connections:** Instead of mapping `Agent -\u003e Connection[]`, we\u0027ll map something like `PortKey -\u003e Connection | Connection[]`. This makes finding interactions based on specific port connections more direct. A `PortKey` could be a unique string identifier for a specific port instance on a specific agent.\n2.  **Active Interaction Set:** Instead of iterating through *all* connections on every `step`, maintain a set or queue of potentially \"active\" connections (pairs of connected ports) that might match a rule. This avoids checking static connections repeatedly.\n3.  **Rule Indexing:** Index rules more effectively, perhaps by `[AgentType1, PortType1, AgentType2, PortType2]` or similar, for faster lookups than just `Agent -\u003e Agent -\u003e Rule`.\n4.  **Stable Iteration:** Use safer iteration patterns, like processing an \"active set\" and collecting changes, then applying changes after the processing loop.\n\n**Revised Internal Representation:**\n\n```typescript\n// src/network.ts (Conceptual Changes)\n\n// --- Representing Ports and Connections ---\n// Unique identifier for a specific port instance on an agent\ntype PortInstanceKey \u003d string;

Ports are identified uniquely using `AgentId#PortName` (`PortInstanceKey`). This provides stable references.\n2.  **`PortConnectivityMap`:** Explicitly stores the 1-to-1 connections between port instances. `connectPorts` enforces this.\n3.  **`ActivePairSet`:** Only connected pairs that *could* interact (based on connection/disconnection events) are stored. `step` iterates over this smaller set, potentially improving performance for large static graphs. We store a canonical string representation for easy management in the Set.\n4.  **`RuleIndex`:** Rules are indexed by a canonical key derived from agent types and port names (`RuleLookupKey`). This allows for O(1) rule lookup during `step` instead of iterating through agent-specific rule maps.\n5.  **Stable Iteration (`step`)**:\n    *   Works on a *copy* of the `activePairs` set.\n    *   *Collects* changes (agents/connections to add/remove) instead of applying them immediately.\n    *   Applies all collected changes *after* iterating through the potential interactions for that step. This prevents modification-during-iteration issues.\n    *   The `step` function now performs *at most one* interaction and then applies changes, ensuring a more controlled, step-by-step reduction. The `reduce` loop calls `step` repeatedly.\n6.  **Clearer API:** Methods like `connectPorts`, `disconnectPorts`, `addAgent`, `removeAgent` now operate with more stable identifiers (IDs, Port Objects) and manage the internal state consistently.\n7.  **Port-Centric Logic:** Interactions are fundamentally found by checking connected port pairs against indexed rules, which aligns well with the interaction net model.\n\n**Remaining Considerations:**\n\n*   **Agent ID Storage:** Assumes an internal `_agentId` property is added to agent objects. This works but slightly modifies the user\u0027s agent objects. An alternative is a separate `Map\u003cIAgent, AgentId\u003e`.\n*   **Connection Name:** Retrieving the original `connectionName` when reconstructing a connection in `getConnection` isn\u0027t straightforward with this model; it might require an additional map `Map\u003cPairKey, ConnectionName\u003e` if needed.\n*   **Rule Specificity:** The `getRuleLookupKey` assumes rules are defined based on agent *types* and port *names*. The `addRule` function and rule definition might need refinement to ensure rules target the correct interactions precisely (e.g., specific agent instances, specific port types).\n*   **Action Context:** The `action` function still gets the agent instances and the network instance. Passing the detailed `IPortConnection` object might also be useful.\n\nThis revised structure provides a more robust, efficient, and scalable foundation for the Annette network, directly addressing the handling of multiple ports and aiming for better performance during reduction.",

The `name` property of an `IPort` identifies the specific port involved.\n2.  **Multiple Instances:** Users can create multiple agents with the same `name` (e.g., `Agent(\u0027counter\u0027, 0)`, `Agent(\u0027counter\u0027, 10)`). Rules apply to *any* interaction between agents with matching names/ports.\n3.  **Agent ID:** An `AgentId` should be assigned upon creation or addition to the network, ensuring uniqueness for internal tracking even if multiple agents share the same `name`.\n\nThis simplifies rule lookup significantly compared to using agent *types* if the `type` field isn\u0027t the primary matching criterion.\n\n**Revised Internal Representation \u0026 Logic:**\n\n```typescript\n// src/network.ts (Relevant parts revised)\n\nimport { IAgent, isAgent, Agent } from \"./agent\"; // Assuming Agent factory is exported\nimport {\n    // ... imports ...\n    IPortConnection, // Keep the detailed connection type\n} from \"./connection\"; // Assuming IPortConnection exists or is defined here\nimport { IBoundPort, IPort, isBoundPort, PortTypes, BoundPort, createBoundPortsMap, PortsMap, PortsDefObj, PortArray } from \"./port\";\nimport { IRule, Action } from \"./rule\";\nimport { v4 as uuidv4 } from \u0027uuid\u0027;\n\n// --- Type Definitions ---\ntype AgentId \u003d string; // Unique identifier for each agent instance\ntype AgentName \u003d string; // The user-defined \u0027name\u0027 (acts as type for rules)\ntype PortName \u003d string;\ntype PortInstanceKey \u003d `${AgentId}#${PortName}`;\n\n// Connection stored internally (can be simpler if needed)\ninterface IInternalConnection {\n    name: string; // User-given name\n    portKey1: PortInstanceKey;\n    portKey2: PortInstanceKey;\n}\n\ntype PortConnectivityMap \u003d Map\u003cPortInstanceKey, PortInstanceKey\u003e; // PortKey -\u003e Partner PortKey\ntype ActivePairSet \u003d Set\u003cstring\u003e; // Canonical \"key1\u003c-\u003ekey2\"\n// Rule key based on AgentName:PortName \u003c-\u003e AgentName:PortName\ntype RuleLookupKey \u003d string; // e.g., \"counter:value\u003c-\u003eincrement:value\" (canonical order)\ntype RuleIndex \u003d Map\u003cRuleLookupKey, IRule\u003e;\ntype AgentRegistry \u003d Map\u003cAgentId, IAgent\u003e; // AgentId -\u003e Agent Instance\n// Keep track of connections associated with a pair key if needed for removal by name\n// type PairConnectionsMap \u003d Map\u003cstring, Set\u003cIInternalConnection\u003e\u003e;\n\n// --- Network State ---\ninterface INetworkState {\n    agents: AgentRegistry;\n    portConnectivity: PortConnectivityMap;\n    activePairs: ActivePairSet;\n    rules: RuleIndex;\n    // Indices for finding agents efficiently\n    agentsByName: Map\u003cAgentName, Set\u003cAgentId\u003e\u003e; // AgentName -\u003e Set\u003cAgentId\u003e\n    // agentsByType: Map\u003cstring, Set\u003cAgentId\u003e\u003e; // Keep if agent.type is still relevant\n    // connectionObjects: Map\u003cstring, IInternalConnection\u003e; // Optional: Store connection details by PairKey\n}\n\n// --- Network Interface (mostly similar) ---\nexport interface INetwork\u003cName extends string, A extends IAgent \u003d IAgent\u003e {\n    // ... same methods as before ...\n    // Adjusted signatures where needed\n    addAgent: \u003cT extends A | IAgent\u003e(agent: T) \u003d\u003e T; // Return the agent with ID added\n    findAgents: (query: { name?: AgentName; /* type?: string */ }) \u003d\u003e IAgent[]; // Query by name primarily\n    // ...\n}\n\n// --- Network Implementation ---\nexport function Network\u003c\n    Name extends string,\n    A extends IAgent \u003d IAgent\n\u003e(name: Name): INetwork\u003cName, A\u003e {\n\n    const networkId \u003d `net-${uuidv4()}`;\n\n    const state: INetworkState \u003d {\n        agents: new Map(),\n        portConnectivity: new Map(),\n        activePairs: new Set(),\n        rules: new Map(),\n        agentsByName: new Map(),\n        // agentsByType: new Map(),\n        // connectionObjects: new Map()\n    };\n\n    // --- Helper Functions ---\n\n    const generateAgentId \u003d (): AgentId \u003d\u003e `agent-${uuidv4()}`;\n    const generatePortKey \u003d (agentId: AgentId, portName: PortName): PortInstanceKey \u003d\u003e `${agentId}#${portName}`;\n    const getAgentId \u003d (agent: IAgent): AgentId | undefined \u003d\u003e (agent as any)._agentId;\n    const setAgentId \u003d (agent: IAgent, id: AgentId): void \u003d\u003e {\n         if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(agent, \u0027_agentId\u0027)) return; // Don\u0027t overwrite\n        Object.defineProperty(agent, \u0027_agentId\u0027, {\n            value: id, writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: false,\n        });\n    }\n    const getPortInstance \u003d (portKey: PortInstanceKey): IBoundPort | undefined \u003d\u003e {\n        const [agentId, portName] \u003d portKey.split(\u0027#\u0027);\n        return state.agents.get(agentId)?.ports?.[portName];\n    };\n    const getCanonicalPairKey \u003d (key1: PortInstanceKey, key2: PortInstanceKey): string \u003d\u003e {\n        return key1 \u003c key2 ?

This is crucial for the internal maps (`AgentRegistry`, `PortInstanceKey`). `addAgent` now returns the agent itself, allowing chaining or retrieval of the ID\u0027d agent.\n2.  **Rule Indexing (`getRuleLookupKey`):** Now correctly uses `agent.name` and `port.name` to generate the canonical key, reflecting the rule matching logic.\n3.  **Rule Definition (`addRule`):** Acknowledges the need for rules to be defined based on agent *names* and port *names*. The current implementation shows how to generate the key but highlights that the `IRule` interface or the `Rule` factory likely needs adjustment to directly accept names instead of relying solely on a template `connection` object with potentially unbound ports/agents. A better `addRule` signature might be `addRule(agentName1, portName1, agentName2, portName2, action, ruleName)`.\n4.  **`findAgents`:** Now queries primarily based on `AgentName` using the `agentsByName` index.\n5.  **State Management:** Internal state (`INetworkState`) uses the appropriate keys (AgentId, AgentName, RuleLookupKey).\n6.  **Result Processing:** The logic clarifies that agents involved in an interaction are removed *unless* they are explicitly returned by the action. All agents returned in the result array are processed via `addAgent` (which handles adding truly new agents and is idempotent for existing ones).\n\nThis version aligns much better with the concept of using agent names as types for rule matching and handles the existence of multiple agent instances with the same name through unique internal IDs. The rule definition/addition process remains the main area needing potential refinement in the `IRule` interface or factory function itself.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process for implementing the `PureRule` concept:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants two types of rules:\n    *   `Rule` (existing): Acts like an effect. Its action function *runs every time* the interaction occurs. It can perform arbitrary logic, access the network, and return agents/connections to modify the graph.\n    *   `PureRule` (new): Represents a *declarative graph rewrite*. Its function runs *only once* (conceptually, at rule definition time) to determine the *static structure* that replaces the interacting pair. This structure (a template of new agents and connections) is then instantiated and inserted every time the rule matches, without re-running the function. This is purely structural and optimized for performance.\n\n2.  **Contrast `Rule` vs. `PureRule`:**\n    *   **Execution:** `Rule` action runs repeatedly. `PureRule` template function runs once.\n    *   **Nature:** `Rule` is imperative/effectful. `PureRule` is declarative/structural.\n    *   **Context:** `Rule` action needs network context. `PureRule` template function *should not* need network context (it defines a static rewrite pattern).\n    *   **Return Value:** `Rule` action returns agents/connections to *keep/add*. `PureRule` template function returns a *description* of the replacement subgraph.\n    *   **Use Case:** `Rule` for state changes, complex logic, effects. `PureRule` for simple, fixed structural rewrites (like basic arithmetic steps in the interaction net examples).\n\n3.  **Designing the `PureRule` Data Structure:**\n    *   Needs to store the *result* of the template function, not the function itself.\n    *   What does the template function return? It needs to describe new agents and how their ports connect to each other *and* to the \"dangling\" ports left after removing the original interacting pair.\n    *   Let\u0027s define a structure for the rewrite template:\n        *   `newAgents`: An array of *template* agent definitions (e.g., `{ name: \u0027add1\u0027, value: undefined, ports: {...} }` - value might be irrelevant if it\u0027s purely structural). Maybe just `{ name: string, initialValue?: any }`.\n        *   `internalConnections`: How the *new* agents connect to each other. Could be an array of `[newAgentIndex1, portName1, newAgentIndex2, portName2]`.\n        *   `externalConnections`: How the *new* agents connect to the *original* non-interacting ports of the consumed pair. Needs to map original ports (identified by agent index 0/1 and port name) to new ports (identified by new agent index and port name). `[{ originalAgentIndex: 0 | 1, originalPortName: string, newAgentIndex: number, newPortName: string }]`.\n\n4.  **Designing the `PureRule` Factory Function:**\n    *   Needs to accept the identifying information (agent names, port names).\n    *   Needs to accept the template function.\n    *   Needs to *call* the template function *once* during rule creation.\n    *   Needs to store the resulting rewrite template structure.\n    *   Signature: `PureRule(agentName1, portName1, agentName2, portName2, templateFn, ruleName)`\n    *   The `templateFn` signature: `(ports1: PortDict, ports2: PortDict) \u003d\u003e RewriteTemplate`. It receives dictionaries representing the *non-interacting* ports of the original pair, allowing the template to specify connections to them.\n\n5.  **Modifying the Network Internals:**\n    *   The `RuleIndex` needs to store *either* an `IRule` or an `IPureRule`. We need a way to distinguish them. Add a `type` field (\u0027imperative\u0027 | \u0027pure\u0027).\n    *   The `step` function needs to check the rule type:\n        *   If \u0027imperative\u0027, execute the `action` function as before.\n        *   If \u0027pure\u0027, retrieve the pre-computed `rewriteTemplate`. Instantiate the template:\n            *   Create actual new `Agent` instances based on `newAgents`.\n            *   Establish `internalConnections` between the new agents.\n            *   Retrieve the *actual* \"dangling\" ports from the original interaction (ports other than the interacting ones).\n            *   Establish `externalConnections` based on the template, connecting new agent ports to these dangling ports.\n            *   Remove the original interacting agents and their connection.\n\n6.  **Handling Dangling Ports:** How does the `step` function know which ports were *not* involved in the interaction?\n    *   When an interaction `port1 \u003c-\u003e port2` is found:\n        *   Agent 1 has ports `P1 \u003d { port1, otherPort1a, otherPort1b, ... }`.\n        *   Agent 2 has ports `P2 \u003d { port2, otherPort2a, otherPort2b, ... }`.\n        *   The \"dangling\" ports are `P1 - {port1}` and `P2 - {port2}`.\n        *   Each of these dangling ports might be connected to *other* parts of the network. Let\u0027s call these `partnerPort(otherPort1a)`, etc.\n        *   The `externalConnections` in the `PureRule` template need to specify which *new* port connects to the *partner* of which *original dangling* port.\n        *   Example: `externalConnections: [{ originalAgentIndex: 0, originalPortName: \u0027otherPort1a\u0027, newAgentIndex: 0, newPortName: \u0027input\u0027 }]` means: Find the port that `otherPort1a` *was* connected to. Disconnect `otherPort1a`. Connect the `input` port of the first new agent (`newAgentIndex: 0`) to that partner port.\n\n7.  **Refining the `RewriteTemplate` and `templateFn`:**\n    *   The `templateFn` doesn\u0027t need full `PortDict` arguments. It just needs to *declare* the new structure.\n    *   The `externalConnections` needs to be precise. Let\u0027s simplify: Map the original non-interacting port (by name) to the new port (by index/name) that should take its place.\n        ```typescript\n        interface RewriteTemplate {\n            newAgentDefs: { name: string; initialValue?: any }[]; // Definitions for new agents\n            internalConnections: { // Connections between new agents\n                agent1Index: number; port1Name: string;\n                agent2Index: number; port2Name: string;\n            }[];\n            portMap: { // Map original non-principal ports to new ports\n                [originalPortName: string]: { newAgentIndex: number; newPortName: string } | null; // null means erase\n            };\n            // We need separate maps for agent1 and agent2\u0027s ports\n             portMap1: { ... }; // Maps agent1\u0027s non-interacting ports\n             portMap2: { ... }; // Maps agent2\u0027s non-interacting ports\n        }\n        // templateFn signature: () \u003d\u003e RewriteTemplate\n        ```\n    *   The `step` function, when applying a `PureRule`:\n        1.  Identify interacting ports `p1`, `p2` and agents `a1`, `a2`.\n        2.  Get the `RewriteTemplate` from the `IPureRule`.\n        3.  Create new agent instances from `newAgentDefs`. Assign IDs.\n        4.  Disconnect `p1` from `p2`.\n        5.  For each `otherPort` in `a1.ports` (where `otherPort !\u003d\u003d p1`):\n            *   Find its `partnerPort` (using `portConnectivity`).\n            *   Disconnect `otherPort` from `partnerPort`.\n            *   Look up `otherPort.name` in `template.portMap1`.\n            *   If mapped to `{ newAgentIndex, newPortName }`:\n                *   Find the `newPort` on the corresponding new agent.\n                *   Connect `newPort` to `partnerPort`.\n            *   If mapped to `null` or not found, the connection is simply dropped (erasure).\n        6.  Repeat step 5 for `a2` using `portMap2`.\n        7.  Establish `internalConnections` between the new agents.\n        8.  Remove `a1` and `a2`.\n\n8.  **Code Implementation:** Update interfaces (`IRule`, add `IPureRule`), add the `PureRule` factory, modify `RuleIndex` value type, and update the `step` function\u0027s rule processing logic.

Define `IPureRule` and `RewriteTemplate` Interfaces**\n\nWe need structures to hold the pre-computed rewrite information.\n\n```typescript\n// src/rule.ts (or a new file like src/pure_rule.ts)\n\nimport { IAgent } from \"./agent\";\nimport { IBoundPort } from \"./port\";\nimport { IConnection } from \"./connection\";\n\n// Describes a new agent to be created in the rewrite\nexport interface NewAgentDef {\n    name: string;       // The \u0027name\u0027 (type) of the new agent\n    initialValue?: any; // Optional initial value for the new agent\n    // Ports are implicitly defined by the agent\u0027s blueprint/constructor\n}\n\n// Describes how a port on a new agent connects internally or externally\nexport interface PortConnectionTarget {\n    newAgentIndex: number; // Index in the RewriteTemplate.newAgents array\n    portName: string;      // Port name on that new agent\n}\n\n// Describes how the original \"dangling\" ports (excluding the interacting ones)\n// should be reconnected after the rewrite.\nexport interface ExternalConnectionMap {\n    // Key: Port name on the *original* interacting agent (agent1 or agent2)\n    // Value: Which port on a *new* agent it should connect to, or null to erase\n    [originalPortName: string]: PortConnectionTarget | null;\n}\n\n// The pre-computed result of a PureRule\u0027s template function\nexport interface RewriteTemplate {\n    newAgents: NewAgentDef[];\n    // Connections between the newly created agents\n    internalConnections: {\n        agent1Index: number; port1Name: string;\n        agent2Index: number; port2Name: string;\n        connectionName?: string;\n    }[];\n    // How agent1\u0027s *other* ports reconnect (key is original port name)\n    portMapAgent1: ExternalConnectionMap;\n    // How agent2\u0027s *other* ports reconnect (key is original port name)\n    portMapAgent2: ExternalConnectionMap;\n}\n\n// Interface for a PureRule, stored in the RuleIndex\nexport interface IPureRule {\n    type: \u0027pure\u0027;       // Discriminator\n    name: string;       // Name of the rule\n    // Information about the agents/ports this rule matches (for debugging/info)\n    matchInfo: {\n        agentName1: string; portName1: string;\n        agentName2: string; portName2: string;\n    };\n    rewriteTemplate: RewriteTemplate; // The pre-calculated rewrite structure\n}\n\n// Template function signature: Returns the static rewrite structure\nexport type RewriteTemplateFn \u003d () \u003d\u003e RewriteTemplate;\n\n// Type guard for IPureRule\nexport function isPureRule(rule: any): rule is IPureRule {\n    return typeof rule \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027object\u0027 \u0026\u0026 rule !\u003d\u003d null \u0026\u0026 rule.type \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027pure\u0027 \u0026\u0026 rule.rewriteTemplate;\n}\n\n// --- Existing IRule needs a type discriminator ---\nimport { Action } from \"./rule\"; // Assuming original Action/IRule are in rule.ts\nimport { INetwork } from \"./network\";\n\nexport interface IRule {\n    type: \u0027imperative\u0027; // Discriminator\n    name: string;\n    // Keep original structure, but Action type needs network context\n    connection: IConnection\u003cany, any, any, any, any\u003e; // Or just store match info like IPureRule?\n    action: Action\u003cINetwork\u003cany, any\u003e, any, any\u003e;\n}\n\n// Type guard for IRule (adjust if needed)\nexport function isRule(rule: any): rule is IRule {\n     return typeof rule \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027object\u0027 \u0026\u0026 rule !\u003d\u003d null \u0026\u0026 rule.type \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027imperative\u0027 \u0026\u0026 typeof rule.action \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027function\u0027;\n}\n\n// Union type for storage\nexport type AnyRule \u003d IRule | IPureRule;\n\n```\n\n**2. Create `PureRule` Factory Function**\n\nThis function takes the matching criteria and the template function, executes the function once, and creates the `IPureRule` object.\n\n```typescript\n// src/pure_rule.ts (or rule.ts)\n\n// Import necessary types: AgentName, PortName, RewriteTemplateFn, IPureRule etc.\nimport { Agent } from \"./agent\"; // Need Agent factory\n\nexport function PureRule(\n    agentName1: AgentName,\n    portName1: PortName,\n    agentName2: AgentName,\n    portName2: PortName,\n    templateFn: RewriteTemplateFn,\n    ruleName: string // Optional but good practice\n): IPureRule {\n\n    if (typeof templateFn !\u003d\u003d \u0027function\u0027) {\n        throw new Error(`PureRule \"${ruleName}\": templateFn must be a function.`);\n    }\n\n    // Execute the template function ONCE to get the rewrite structure\n    let rewriteTemplate: RewriteTemplate;\n    try {\n        rewriteTemplate \u003d templateFn();\n        // TODO: Add validation for the returned rewriteTemplate structure?\n        if (!rewriteTemplate || !Array.isArray(rewriteTemplate.newAgents)) {\n             throw new Error(\"Invalid RewriteTemplate returned.\");\n        }\n    } catch (error: any) {\n        throw new Error(`PureRule \"${ruleName}\": Error executing templateFn: ${error.message}`);\n    }\n\n    // Create the PureRule object containing the pre-computed template\n    const pureRule: IPureRule \u003d {\n        type: \u0027pure\u0027,\n        name: ruleName,\n        matchInfo: { // Store matching info for clarity\n            agentName1, portName1,\n            agentName2, portName2,\n        },\n        rewriteTemplate: rewriteTemplate,\n    };\n\n    return pureRule;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Modify Network Internals (`src/network.ts`)**\n\n*   Update `RuleIndex` type.\n*   Update `addRule` to handle both `IRule` and `IPureRule`.\n*   Update `step` function to differentiate rule execution.\n\n```typescript\n// src/network.ts (Revised parts)\n\n// --- Type Definitions ---\n// ...

It determines the rule type and generates the correct `RuleLookupKey` based on agent/port names. (The key generation part still feels slightly awkward and might indicate the rule definition API needs a rethink for better ergonomics).\n5.  **`step()` Logic:**\n    *   Finds the rule using the lookup key.\n    *   Checks `rule.type`.\n    *   **If \u0027pure\u0027:**\n        *   Retrieves the `rewriteTemplate`.\n        *   Creates new agent instances using `createAgentInstance` (which needs access to agent blueprints/factory).\n        *   Adds new agents to the batch (`agentsToAdd`).\n        *   Iterates through the *other* ports of the *original* interacting agents (`agent1`, `agent2`).\n        *   For each `otherPort`, finds its partner (`partnerKey`, `partnerPort`).\n        *   Marks the original connection (`otherPortKey \u003c-\u003e partnerKey`) for disconnection (`portsToDisconnect`).\n        *   Uses `template.portMapAgent1` / `portMapAgent2` to find the corresponding new port (if any).\n        *   If a mapping exists, adds the *new* connection definition (`newPortKey \u003c-\u003e partnerKey`) to the batch (`connectionsToAddDefs`).\n        *   Adds internal connection definitions between new agents to the batch.\n        *   Marks the original interacting agents (`agent1`, `agent2`) for removal (`agentsToRemove`).\n    *   **If \u0027imperative\u0027:**\n        *   Executes the `action` function as before.\n        *   Processes results, collecting agents/connections for batch addition/removal.\n        *   Converts returned `IConnection` objects into `connectionsToAddDefs` using port keys.\n    *   **Batch Application:** After the loop (which breaks after one interaction), the collected changes (`portsToDisconnect`, `agentsToRemove`, `agentsToAdd`, `connectionsToAddDefs`) are applied in a safe order.\n\nThis implementation separates the declarative rewrites (`PureRule`) from the imperative effects (`Rule`), allowing the runtime to bypass JS function execution for pure rules, potentially leading to significant performance gains for structurally intensive computations.",

    }, {
      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s critically review the design incorporating `PureRule` and identify areas for potential improvement and refinement.\n\n**Strengths of the Current Design:**\n\n*   **Clear Separation:** Successfully distinguishes between imperative (`Rule`) and declarative (`PureRule`) interactions.\n*   **Potential Performance:** `PureRule` bypasses runtime JS execution for rewrites, offering significant optimization potential.\n*   **Stable Internals:** Uses unique IDs and batch processing for safer state modifications during `step`.\n*   **Port-Centric:** Enforces 1-to-1 port connections and uses port keys internally.\n*   **Name-Based Matching:** Correctly uses agent/port names for rule lookups.\n\n**Areas for Improvement and Refinement:**\n\n1.  **Rule Definition Ergonomics (`addRule` / Rule Factories):**\n    *   **Problem:** Generating the `RuleLookupKey` inside `addRule` by creating temporary/mock agents/ports based on names extracted from the rule object is awkward and error-prone. The `IRule`/`IPureRule` interfaces don\u0027t cleanly enforce how agent/port names should be specified *for matching*.\n    *   **Refinement:**\n        *   Define dedicated factory functions (or overloaded `Rule`/`PureRule`) that take agent/port *names* directly:\n            ```typescript\n            // For Imperative Rules\n            function Rule(\n                ruleName: string,\n                agentName1: AgentName, portName1: PortName,\n                agentName2: AgentName, portName2: PortName,\n                action: Action\u003c...\u003e // Action still operates on agent *instances*\n            ): IRule;\n\n            // For Pure Rules\n            function PureRule(\n                ruleName: string,\n                agentName1: AgentName, portName1: PortName,\n                agentName2: AgentName, portName2: PortName,\n                templateFn: RewriteTemplateFn\n            ): IPureRule;\n            ```\n        *   The `addRule` method then simply uses these names directly to generate the `RuleLookupKey`.\n        *   The `IRule`/`IPureRule` interfaces store this `matchInfo` explicitly, removing the need for the problematic `connection` property on `IRule` just for matching purposes.\n\n2.  **Agent Creation in `PureRule` (`createAgentInstance`):**\n    *   **Problem:** The `step` function currently assumes a simple `Agent(name, initialValue)` factory exists globally or is imported. This might not be flexible enough if agents require complex construction or specific blueprints.\n    *   **Refinement:**\n        *   Introduce an `AgentBlueprint` concept or require the network to be configured with agent factories/constructors.\n        *   The `NewAgentDef` in `RewriteTemplate` could reference a registered blueprint name instead of just `agent.name`.\n        *   The `createAgentInstance` helper within the network would then use this blueprint registry: `network.createAgentFromBlueprint(def.blueprintName, def.initialValue)`.\n\n3.  **`RewriteTemplate` Complexity and Validation:**\n    *   **Problem:** The `RewriteTemplate` structure is powerful but complex. Defining it manually in the `templateFn` could be tedious and error-prone. Validation is currently minimal.\n    *   **Refinement:**\n        *   **Builder Pattern:** Provide a `RewriteTemplateBuilder` class or helper functions within the `templateFn`\u0027s scope to construct the template more fluently and with built-in validation:\n            ```typescript\n            PureRule(\"...\", \"...\", \"...\", \"...\", () \u003d\u003e {\n                const builder \u003d new RewriteTemplateBuilder();\n                const newAgent0 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"newNode\", { value: 1 }); // Returns an index or handle\n                const newAgent1 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"anotherNode\");\n\n                // Connect new agents internally\n                builder.connectInternal(newAgent0, \"out\", newAgent1, \"in\");\n\n                // Map external ports (e.g., originalAgent1\u0027s \"dataOut\" connects to newAgent0\u0027s \"dataIn\")\n                builder.mapExternalPort(\"agent1\", \"dataOut\", newAgent0, \"dataIn\");\n                builder.mapExternalPort(\"agent2\", \"controlOut\", newAgent1, \"controlIn\");\n                // Erase a port\n                builder.eraseExternalPort(\"agent1\", \"unusedPort\");\n\n                return builder.build(); // Builds and validates the template\n            }, \"MyRewrite\");\n            ```\n        *   **Validation:** Implement thorough validation within `PureRule` or the builder to check for dangling internal connections, incorrect indices, missing port mappings, etc.\n\n4.  **State Management in `Action` (Imperative Rules):**\n    *   **Problem:** While `action` gets agent instances, directly mutating `agent.value` inside might feel impure or lead to unexpected side effects if not handled carefully within the batching/reduction cycle.\n    *   **Refinement:**\n        *   **Clarity:** Emphasize in documentation that `action` functions are for imperative logic and side effects.\n        *   **Return Values:** Consider standardizing return values. Instead of just returning agents to keep them, perhaps return specific instruction objects: `KeepAgent(agent)`, `UpdateAgentValue(agent, newValue)`, `AddNewAgent(def)`, `RemoveAgentById(id)`, `AddConnection(p1, p2)`, `RemoveConnection(p1, p2)`. The `step` function would then interpret these instructions. This makes the action\u0027s intent more explicit but adds verbosity. (Current \"return to keep\" is simpler but less explicit).\n\n5.  **Connection Identification \u0026 Removal:**\n    *   **Problem:** `disconnectPorts` currently requires the two `IBoundPort` objects. If an action or external logic only has agent IDs or port keys, disconnecting becomes harder. The `step` function collects `portsToDisconnect` based on keys.\n    *   **Refinement:** Ensure `disconnectPorts` can *also* accept `portKey1, portKey2` as arguments, simplifying removal logic within `step` and potentially externally.\n\n6.  **`ActivePairSet` Granularity:**\n    *   **Problem:** Adding a connection adds the pair to `activePairs`. If a rule doesn\u0027t exist for that pair, it stays in the set and is checked fruitlessly on subsequent steps.\n    *   **Refinement:** When adding a connection (`connectPorts`), immediately check if a rule exists for the corresponding `RuleLookupKey`. *Only* add the pair to `activePairs` if a potential rule exists. This prevents bloating the active set with inert connections.\n\n7.  **Error Handling in `step`:**\n    *   **Problem:** Currently, an error in an `action` function logs the error and continues. Depending on the application, this might leave the network in an inconsistent state.\n    *   **Refinement:** Provide configuration options for error handling:\n        *   `onError: \u0027continue\u0027` (current behavior)\n        *   `onError: \u0027halt\u0027` (stop reduction immediately)\n        *   `onError: (error, rule, agents) \u003d\u003e void` (custom error handler callback)\n\n8.  **API Consistency (`connectPorts` vs. `network.connect`):**\n    *   **Problem:** The previous API had `network.connect` which could take agents or ports. The new internal structure favors `connectPorts`.\n    *   **Refinement:** Make `connectPorts` the primary public method. Offer convenience wrappers if needed:\n        ```typescript\n        // In Network class\n        public connect(agent1: IAgent, agent2: IAgent, portName1: string \u003d \u0027main\u0027, portName2: string \u003d \u0027main\u0027, connName?: string) {\n            const p1 \u003d agent1.ports[portName1];\n            const p2 \u003d agent2.ports[portName2];\n            if (p1 \u0026\u0026 p2 \u0026\u0026 isBoundPort(p1) \u0026\u0026 isBoundPort(p2)) { // Check ports exist and are bound\n                 return this.connectPorts(p1, p2, connName);\n            }\n            console.error(\"Failed to connect agents: Ports not found or invalid.\");\n            return undefined;\n        }\n        ```\n\nBy incorporating these refinements, particularly the ergonomic rule definition, agent blueprint handling, and the rewrite template builder, the library becomes significantly more user-friendly, robust, and maintainable while retaining the core performance benefits of the `PureRule` optimization.",

While standard `Rule`s execute a JavaScript function (`action`) every time matching agents interact, `PureRule`s offer a way to define purely structural graph rewrites declaratively, leading to potentially significant performance improvements for common patterns.\n\n### `PureRule`\n\nA `PureRule` defines an interaction between two types of agents (identified by their `name` property) connected via specific ports (identified by `port.name`). Instead of an action function, it uses a `RewriteTemplate` which describes exactly how the interacting pair and their immediate connections should be replaced.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Declarative:** You define *what* the resulting subgraph looks like, not *how* to compute it step-by-step.\n*   **Pre-Computed:** The structure of the replacement subgraph (`RewriteTemplate`) is determined *once* when the `PureRule` is created.\n*   **Fast Execution:** At runtime, when matching agents interact, the network directly performs the graph surgery described by the template, bypassing JavaScript function execution for the rule itself.\n*   **Consumption:** The two agents involved in a `PureRule` interaction are always consumed (removed) and replaced by the agents defined in the template.\n*   **Use Cases:** Ideal for common structural transformations like:\n    *   Implementing algebraic identities (e.g., `dup(zero) \u003d\u003e zero; zero`).\n    *   Simplifying standard data structure operations (e.g., unwrapping a layer in a list representation).\n    *   Defining combinators or basic functions that only rearrange connections and create fixed structures.\n\n**Creating a `PureRule`:**\n\nYou typically use the `PureRule` factory function:\n\n```typescript\nimport { PureRule, RewriteTemplateBuilder } from \u0027annette\u0027; // Assuming these are exported\n\n// Example: Rule for duplicating a \u0027Zero\u0027 agent (represented by name \u0027zero\u0027)\n// Interaction: dup:out \u003c-\u003e zero:value\nconst dupZeroRule \u003d PureRule(\n    \"dupZeroRewrite\", // Rule Name (for debugging)\n    \"dup\", \"out\",      // AgentName1, PortName1\n    \"zero\", \"value\",   // AgentName2, PortName2\n    () \u003d\u003e { // Template Function (runs once at definition time)\n        const builder \u003d new RewriteTemplateBuilder();\n\n        // Create the replacement agents\n        const zero1 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"zero\"); // Creates a new \u0027zero\u0027 agent\n        const zero2 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"zero\"); // Creates another new \u0027zero\u0027 agent\n\n        // Map the original \u0027dup\u0027 agent\u0027s *other* ports.\n        // Let\u0027s assume \u0027dup\u0027 has ports \u0027in\u0027, \u0027out1\u0027, \u0027out2\u0027 (besides \u0027out\u0027 which interacted)\n        // Connect original \u0027dup.out1\u0027 to the new \u0027zero1.value\u0027\n        builder.mapExternalPort(\"dup\", \"out1\", zero1, \"value\");\n        // Connect original \u0027dup.out2\u0027 to the new \u0027zero2.value\u0027\n        builder.mapExternalPort(\"dup\", \"out2\", zero2, \"value\");\n        // Erase the original \u0027dup.in\u0027 port (its connection partner will dangle or be handled elsewhere)\n        builder.eraseExternalPort(\"dup\", \"in\");\n\n        // The original \u0027zero\u0027 agent only had \u0027value\u0027 which interacted, so no external ports to map.\n\n        // No internal connections needed between the two new \u0027zero\u0027 agents.\n\n        return builder.build(); // Generate the RewriteTemplate\n    }\n);\n\n// Add the rule to the network\nnetwork.addRule(dupZeroRule);\n```\n\n### `RewriteTemplate`\n\nThis is the core data structure generated by the `PureRule`\u0027s template function. It contains all the information needed for the network runtime to perform the graph rewrite.\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```typescript\ninterface RewriteTemplate {\n    // 1. Definitions of new agents to create in the replacement subgraph.\n    newAgents: NewAgentDef[];\n\n    // 2. Connections *between* the ports of these newly created agents.\n    internalConnections: InternalConnectionDef[];\n\n    // 3. Mapping for the *other* (non-interacting) ports of the FIRST original agent.\n    portMapAgent1: ExternalConnectionMap;\n\n    // 4. Mapping for the *other* (non-interacting) ports of the SECOND original agent.\n    portMapAgent2: ExternalConnectionMap;\n}\n\n// -- Supporting Types --\n\ninterface NewAgentDef {\n    name: string;       // \u0027name\u0027 (type) of the new agent (e.g., \"zero\", \"increment\")\n    initialValue?: any; // Optional initial value for the new agent\n    // Or: blueprintName: string; // Alternative using registered blueprints\n}\n\ninterface InternalConnectionDef {\n    agent1Index: number;   // Index in newAgents array for the first agent\n    port1Name: string;     // Port name on the first new agent\n    agent2Index: number;   // Index in newAgents array for the second agent\n    port2Name: string;     // Port name on the second new agent\n    connectionName?: string; // Optional name for the new connection\n}\n\n// Describes where an external port (from an original agent) connects to *within* the new subgraph\ninterface PortConnectionTarget {\n    newAgentIndex: number; // Index in newAgents array\n    portName: string;      // Port name on that new agent\n}\n\n// Maps original external port names to their new target (or null to erase)\ninterface ExternalConnectionMap {\n    [originalPortName: string]: PortConnectionTarget | null;\n}\n```\n\n**How the Rewrite Works:**\n\n1.  **Match:** The network finds two connected agents (`agent1`, `agent2`) via specific ports (`port1`, `port2`) that match a registered `PureRule`.\n2.  **Consume:** `agent1` and `agent2` are marked for removal. The connection between `port1` and `port2` is removed.\n3.  **Instantiate:** The network creates new agent instances based on the `newAgents` definitions in the `rewriteTemplate`.\n4.  **Connect Internals:** New connections are established between the new agents as defined by `internalConnections`.\n5.  **Reconnect Externals:**\n    *   For each *other* port (`otherPort`) on the original `agent1`:\n        *   Find what it was originally connected to (`partnerPort`).\n        *   Remove the original connection (`otherPort \u003c-\u003e partnerPort`).\n        *   Look up `otherPort.name` in `portMapAgent1`.\n        *   If a `PortConnectionTarget` is found, create a *new* connection between the specified new port (`targetNewPort`) and the original `partnerPort`.\n        *   If the mapping is `null` or not found, the `partnerPort` is left dangling (its connection is effectively erased).\n    *   Repeat the process for `agent2` using `portMapAgent2`.\n\n### `RewriteTemplateBuilder` (Recommended)\n\nManually creating `RewriteTemplate` objects can be complex. Using a builder pattern simplifies this:\n\n```typescript\n// Inside the PureRule template function:\nconst builder \u003d new RewriteTemplateBuilder();\n\n// Add agents, returns a handle/index\nconst handle1 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"agentName\", { initialValue: ... });\nconst handle2 \u003d builder.addAgent(\"otherName\");\n\n// Connect newly added agents\nbuilder.connectInternal(handle1, \"portA\", handle2, \"portB\", \"internal-link\");\n\n// Map external ports\n// Assume rule matched \"agent1Name:port1Name \u003c-\u003e agent2Name:port2Name\"\n// Connect original agent1Name\u0027s \u0027otherPortX\u0027 to new agent handle1\u0027s \u0027inputPort\u0027\nbuilder.mapExternalPort(\"agent1Name\", \"otherPortX\", handle1, \"inputPort\");\n// Connect original agent2Name\u0027s \u0027otherPortY\u0027 to new agent handle2\u0027s \u0027outputPort\u0027\nbuilder.mapExternalPort(\"agent2Name\", \"otherPortY\", handle2, \"outputPort\");\n// Erase original agent1Name\u0027s \u0027unusedPort\u0027\nbuilder.eraseExternalPort(\"agent1Name\", \"unusedPort\");\n\n// Build the template\nconst template \u003d builder.build();\n```\n\n*(Note: The exact builder API might vary based on implementation details).*\n\n### Choosing Between `Rule` and `PureRule`\n\n*   Use `PureRule` when the interaction is a fixed, structural transformation without side effects or complex state dependencies. This is often the case for basic data constructors, destructors, or algebraic simplifications.\n*   Use `Rule` when the interaction:\n    *   Needs to modify the `value` of the interacting agents.\n    *   Needs to perform conditional logic based on agent values.\n    *   Needs to access the wider network state.\n    *   Needs to perform external side effects (logging, I/O).\n    *   Involves complex logic that is hard to express as a static rewrite.\n\nBy leveraging `PureRule` for common, performance-sensitive rewrites, you can significantly optimize your Annette network\u0027s execution speed.\n\n---",

The `RewriteRule` needs this structure defined *statically*. We can\u0027t just use the exact same function signature because the arguments (`agent1`, `agent2`) aren\u0027t available when `DefineRewrite` runs.\n\n**Proposed API Idea:**\n\nUse a builder function passed to `DefineRewrite` that captures the structure.\n\n```typescript\n// In rule definitions file\n\nimport { Agent, connect, RewriteBuilder } from \u0027annette\u0027; // Assuming Agent factory and connect utility\n\n// Factory function for the rule\nfunction RewriteRule(\n    ruleName: string,\n    agentName1: AgentName, portName1: PortName,\n    agentName2: AgentName, portName2: PortName,\n    // The builder function takes a \"builder\" object\n    // It doesn\u0027t receive runtime agents, but uses the builder\n    // to define the static rewrite structure.\n    buildRewrite: (builder: RewriteBuilder) \u003d\u003e void\n): IRewriteRule; // IRewriteRule is the new name for IPureRule\n\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\n\nnetwork.addRule(RewriteRule(\n    \"dupZeroRewrite\",\n    \"dup\", \"out\",\n    \"zero\", \"value\",\n    (builder) \u003d\u003e {\n        // Define the agents to create\n        const zero1 \u003d builder.add(\"zero\"); // Returns a handle/symbol representing this new agent\n        const zero2 \u003d builder.add(\"zero\");\n\n        // Define internal connections using handles\n        // builder.connect(zero1, \"value\", zero2, \"value\"); // Example if needed\n\n        // Define how original ports map to new ports\n        // builder.link(OriginalPortRef, NewPortRef)\n        // Needs symbolic references to original ports: builder.original(\u0027dup\u0027, \u0027out1\u0027) ?\n        builder.link(builder.original(1, \"out1\"), builder.port(zero1, \"value\"));\n        builder.link(builder.original(1, \"out2\"), builder.port(zero2, \"value\"));\n        builder.link(builder.original(1, \"in\"), builder.erase()); // Erase the connection\n\n        // No links needed for original(\u0027zero\u0027, ...) since \u0027value\u0027 was the interacting port.\n    }\n));\n\n// --- Potential RewriteBuilder API ---\n\ninterface RewriteBuilder {\n    /** Defines a new agent to be created in the rewrite. Returns a handle. */\n    add(agentName: AgentName, initialValue?: any): AgentHandle;\n    add(blueprint: AgentBlueprint): AgentHandle; // Alternative\n\n    /** Defines a connection between ports of newly created agents. */\n    connect(\n        handle1: AgentHandle, portName1: PortName,\n        handle2: AgentHandle, portName2: PortName,\n        connectionName?: string\n    ): void;\n\n    /** Defines how an external port (from original agents) should be re-linked or erased. */\n    link(from: OriginalPortRef, to: NewPortRef | EraseHandle): void;\n\n    /** Creates a reference to a port on a newly defined agent. */\n    port(handle: AgentHandle, portName: PortName): NewPortRef;\n\n    /** Creates a reference to a non-interacting port on one of the original agents. */\n    original(agentIndex: 1 | 2, portName: PortName): OriginalPortRef;\n    original(agentName: AgentName, portName: PortName): OriginalPortRef; // Alternative using names\n\n    /** Represents erasing an external connection. */\n    erase(): EraseHandle;\n\n    // Internal method to generate the Rewrite structure\n    // build(): Rewrite;\n}\n\n// Opaque types for clarity\ntype AgentHandle \u003d symbol | number;\ntype OriginalPortRef \u003d object;\ntype NewPortRef \u003d object;\ntype EraseHandle \u003d object;\n\n// IRewriteRule would store the compiled Rewrite structure generated by the builder\n```\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   **Similarity:** The user provides agent names and port names to identify the interaction, similar to how an `ActionRule` might be keyed. The *body* of the definition conceptually describes the output.\n*   **Difference:** The `RewriteRule` uses a builder function (`buildRewrite`) that executes *once* at definition time. It operates on symbolic handles (`AgentHandle`) and references (`OriginalPortRef`, `NewPortRef`) rather than runtime agent instances. It constructs the static `Rewrite` data structure. An `ActionRule`\u0027s function executes at *runtime* with actual agent instances.\n*   **Clarity:** This builder API makes the *intent* clearer â€“ defining connections and agents structurally. It hides the complexity of the underlying `Rewrite` data structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.  **Names:** `RewriteRule` (for pure/static) and `ActionRule` (for imperative/dynamic) seem like clearer names reflecting their function within the library. `Rewrite` can replace `RewriteTemplate`.\n2.  **API:** Introducing a `RewriteBuilder` passed to the definition function (`buildRewrite`) provides a more ergonomic and less error-prone way to define the static graph rewrite structure compared to manually constructing the `Rewrite` object. It allows a syntax that *feels* somewhat like connecting agents, even though it\u0027s happening statically. This approach achieves a better balance between aligning the APIs conceptually and respecting the fundamental difference in their execution time and purpose.",

These placeholders don\u0027t have state or IDs. They primarily serve to allow the `captureFn` to reference ports like `agent1.port(\u0027otherPort\u0027)`.\n        *   It calls `captureFn`, passing these placeholders and utilities (`agent`, `connect`).\n        *   The `captureFn` executes *once*. It uses `utils.agent(...)` to define new agents and `utils.connect(...)` between these new agents *or* between a new agent\u0027s port and an *external* port referenced via `agent1.port(\u0027otherPort\u0027)` or `agent2.port(\u0027otherPort\u0027)`.\n        *   The factory *intercepts* the calls to `utils.agent` and `utils.connect`. Instead of creating real runtime objects, it records:\n            *   Definitions of the new agents requested.\n            *   Definitions of connections requested *between* the new agents (internal connections).\n            *   Definitions of connections requested between a new agent\u0027s port and an external port reference (external links).\n        *   It analyzes the returned array and the intercepted calls to build the `capturedRewrite` structure, figuring out `newAgents`, `internalConnections`, and `externalLinks`. Ports on the original template agents that were *not* used as a source in an external link are considered erased.\n        *   It stores this `capturedRewrite` data within the `ICaptureRule` object.\n\n3.  **Runtime Execution (`step` function):**\n    *   When a connection matches an `ICaptureRule`:\n        *   Retrieve the `capturedRewrite` data.\n        *   Instantiate the `newAgents` from their definitions.\n        *   Establish the `internalConnections` between these new instances.\n        *   For each `externalLink`:\n            *   Find the original port on the *actual* interacting agent (`runtimeAgent1` or `runtimeAgent2`) corresponding to `originalPortName`.\n            *   Find what that port was connected *to* externally (`partnerPort`).\n            *   Disconnect the original external connection.\n            *   Find the specified port on the *newly instantiated* agent (`newRuntimeAgent`).\n            *   Connect the `newRuntimeAgent`\u0027s port to the `partnerPort`.\n        *   Disconnect the interacting ports.\n        *   Remove the original interacting agents (`runtimeAgent1`, `runtimeAgent2`).\n\n**Advantages of this \"Capture-by-Example\" Approach:**\n\n*   **Intuitive API:** The `captureFn` looks very similar to how one might write the body of an imperative `ActionRule`, returning the desired output structure. This feels natural.\n*   **Less Boilerplate:** Avoids the need for a separate `RewriteBuilder` API. The structure is defined using familiar `Agent` and `connect` calls (intercepted).\n*   **Direct Mapping:** More directly captures the \"input -\u003e output graph\" idea of a rewrite rule.\n\n**Disadvantages/Challenges:**\n\n*   **Magic/Interception:** Relies on intercepting calls within `captureFn` to build the static structure. This can feel a bit \"magic\" compared to an explicit builder. Requires careful implementation of the interception mechanism.\n*   **Placeholder Limitations:** The `TemplateAgent` placeholders are limited. The `captureFn` cannot inspect their state (they have none) or perform complex logic based on runtime values, reinforcing that this is only for static structural rewrites.\n*   **External Port Referencing:** The mechanism for referencing external ports (`agent1.port(\u0027other\u0027)`) needs to be robust and clearly defined within the `TemplateAgent`.\n*   **Validation:** Validation of the captured structure (e.g., ensuring ports exist, connections are valid) needs to happen after the `captureFn` runs and the structure is analyzed.\n\n**Refined Names:**\n\n*   `PureRule` / `CaptureRule` -\u003e **`RewriteRule`** (Still seems best, emphasizing the outcome) or **`StaticRule`**. Let\u0027s stick with `RewriteRule`.\n*   `Rule` (Imperative) -\u003e **`ActionRule`**.\n*   `captureFn` -\u003e **`defineRewrite`** (Function name).\n*   `ICaptureRule` -\u003e **`IRewriteRule`**.\n*   `capturedRewrite` -\u003e **`rewrite`**.\n*   `TemplateAgent` -\u003e **`MatchAgent`** or **`RuleInput`**.\n\n**Revised Factory Signature:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction RewriteRule(\n    ruleName: string,\n    agentName1: AgentName, portName1: PortName,\n    agentName2: AgentName, portName2: PortName,\n    // Receives placeholders for the matching agents and utilities\n    defineRewrite: (\n        agent1: MatchAgent,\n        agent2: MatchAgent,\n        utils: { agent: AgentFactory, connect: ConnectUtility }\n    ) \u003d\u003e (IAgent | IConnection)[] // Return signature *looks* like ActionRule\n): IRewriteRule;\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe \"Capture-by-Example\" approach using an intercepted `defineRewrite` function is a very compelling alternative to the explicit builder.\n\n*   **Pros:** Offers a potentially more intuitive and familiar API for defining the rewrite structure, closely mirroring the return value of an `ActionRule`.\n*   **Cons:** Relies on function call interception which can be complex to implement correctly and might feel less explicit than a builder.\n\nBoth the builder approach and this capture-by-example approach achieve the goal of pre-calculating the rewrite. The choice between them comes down to API preference: explicit construction via a builder vs. implicit capture via intercepted function calls. The capture method feels slightly more aligned with the desire to have the pure/rewrite rule definition *look* like the imperative one.",

Network Changes (`src/network.ts`)**\n\n*   The `RuleIndex` now stores `AnyRule \u003d IActionRule | IRewriteRule`.\n*   `addRule` accepts `AnyRule`. It uses the rule\u0027s `matchInfo` (now present on both types) to generate the key.\n*   `step` checks `rule.type`:\n    *   If `\u0027rewrite\u0027`, it retrieves `rule.rewrite` and executes the pre-computed plan (instantiate agents, map connections).\n    *   If `\u0027action\u0027`, it executes `rule.action(agent1, agent2, network)`.\n\n**Advantages of the Dual Approach:**\n\n*   **Flexibility:** Users choose the definition method they prefer.\n    *   **Capture Function:** Good for simpler rewrites where the \"imperative look\" is intuitive. Less verbose for defining connections.\n    *   **Direct Object:** Good for complex rewrites, potentially generated programmatically, or when explicit control over the `Rewrite` structure is desired. Also avoids the \"magic\" of interception.\n*   **Consistency:** Both methods result in the same internal `IRewriteRule` structure containing the static `Rewrite` plan. The runtime execution logic in `step` only needs to handle the `rewrite` type once.\n*   **Clear Naming:** `RewriteRule` clearly indicates its purpose, regardless of how the `Rewrite` object was generated.\n\n**Implementation Note:** The complexity lies in the `analyzeCaptureResult` function needed for the capture-by-example approach. This function needs to robustly parse the output of the user\u0027s function to build the static `Rewrite` structure. Providing the direct object definition bypasses this complexity.",

Let\u0027s call them `JoinPoint` agents.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // Agent definition (conceptually)\n    // No complex value needed, just acts as a structural placeholder\n    Agent(\"JoinPoint\", { id: uniqueJoinId });\n    ```\n    Each `JoinPoint` agent might represent one side of a desired multi-connection.\n\n2.  **The `multiConnect` Function:**\n    This function takes a list of ports (from the actual agents you want to connect) and orchestrates the setup using `JoinPoint` agents and expects a `RewriteRule` to handle the final connection.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // In the Network class or as a standalone utility using the network\n\n    /**\n     * Establishes connections between multiple specified ports using a rewrite rule.\n     * This is an asynchronous operation driven by the network\u0027s reduce cycle.\n     *\n     * @param portsToConnect An array of IBoundPort objects to be connected together.\n     * @param connectionGroupName A name for this multi-connection operation (optional).\n     * @returns A promise that resolves when the connections are likely established (after reduce),\n     *          or void if running synchronously within a batch.\n     */\n    async function multiConnect(\n        network: INetwork\u003cany, any\u003e, // Pass the network instance\n        portsToConnect: IBoundPort[],\n        connectionGroupName: string \u003d `multi-${uuidv4()}`\n    ): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e { // Or return void if synchronous\n\n        if (portsToConnect.length \u003c 2) {\n            console.warn(\"multiConnect requires at least two ports.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // We need a way to link these temporary agents together.\n        // Create one JoinPoint per port initially.\n        const joinPoints: IAgent[] \u003d [];\n        const connectionsToAdd: IConnection[] \u003d [];\n\n        for (let i \u003d 0; i \u003c portsToConnect.length; i++) {\n            const targetPort \u003d portsToConnect[i];\n            // Ensure target agent exists\n            network.addAgent(targetPort.agent);\n\n            // Create a unique JoinPoint for this target port\n            const joinPoint \u003d Agent(\"JoinPoint\", { targetPortKey: generatePortKey(getAgentId(targetPort.agent)!, targetPort.name) });\n             network.addAgent(joinPoint); // Add to network immediately\n            joinPoints.push(joinPoint);\n\n            // Connect the JoinPoint to the actual target port\n            // Use specific ports on JoinPoint, e.g., \u0027target\u0027 and \u0027next\u0027/\u0027link\u0027\n            const jpTargetPort \u003d joinPoint.ports.target; // Assuming JoinPoint has a \u0027target\u0027 port\n            if (!jpTargetPort) throw new Error(\"JoinPoint agent definition missing \u0027target\u0027 port.\");\n            const connToTarget \u003d network.connectPorts(jpTargetPort, targetPort, `${connectionGroupName}-link-${i}`);\n            if (connToTarget) connectionsToAdd.push(connToTarget); // Keep track if needed\n        }\n\n        // Now, connect the JoinPoints in a chain or star pattern.

It consumes them and connects the *target* ports they were linked to.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // Define the agent structure conceptually needed\n    // agent(\u0027JoinPoint\u0027, {}) has ports \u0027target\u0027 (aux) and \u0027link\u0027 (principal!)\n    // Let\u0027s assume \u0027link\u0027 is the principal port for interaction.\n\n    network.addRule(RewriteRule(\n        \"joinPoint-Linker\", // Rule Name\n        \"JoinPoint\", \"link\",  // AgentName1, PortName1 (Principal)\n        \"JoinPoint\", \"link\",  // AgentName2, PortName2 (Principal)\n        () \u003d\u003e {\n            // This template function runs once.\n            // It defines how to connect the \u0027target\u0027 ports of the\n            // two original JoinPoints when the JoinPoints themselves interact.\n            const builder \u003d new RewriteTemplateBuilder();\n\n            // No new agents are created in this specific rewrite.\n\n            // Map external ports:\n            // Connect original Agent1\u0027s \u0027target\u0027 port to original Agent2\u0027s \u0027target\u0027 port\n            builder.link(builder.original(1, \"target\"), builder.original(2, \"target\"));\n            // builder.link(builder.original(2, \"target\"), builder.original(1, \"target\")); // Redundant due to symmetry? Builder handles this.\n\n            // The \u0027link\u0027 ports interacted and are consumed.\n\n            return builder.build();\n        }\n    ));\n    ```\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  `multiConnect` creates a `JoinPoint` agent for each target port (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`, ...).\n2.  It connects each `JoinPoint` (`J1`, `J2`, `J3`, ...) to its corresponding target port (`J1.target \u003c-\u003e P1`, `J2.target \u003c-\u003e P2`, ...).\n3.  It connects the `JoinPoint` agents together in a chain (`J1.link \u003c-\u003e J2.link`, `J2.link \u003c-\u003e J3.link`, ...).\n4.  Calling `network.reduce()` starts the process.\n5.  The `RewriteRule` `joinPoint-Linker` finds the first interaction, e.g., `J1.link \u003c-\u003e J2.link`.\n6.  The rule fires:\n    *   `J1` and `J2` are consumed.\n    *   The connection `J1.link \u003c-\u003e J2.link` is removed.\n    *   The rule\u0027s `Rewrite` dictates connecting `J1`\u0027s original external `target` port partner (which is `P1`) to `J2`\u0027s original external `target` port partner (which is `P2`). So, a connection `P1 \u003c-\u003e P2` is created.\n    *   The original connections `J1.target \u003c-\u003e P1` and `J2.target \u003c-\u003e P2` are removed as part of consuming `J1` and `J2`.\n7.  The `reduce` cycle continues. Now `J2` is gone, but its `link` port was *also* connected to `J3.link`. The rewrite logic needs to handle the dangling `partnerPort` correctly. In the previous step, when `J1.target` was linked to `J2.target`, the `partnerPort` for `J2.link` (which is `J3.link`) was left dangling.\n8.  **Correction:** The rewrite rule needs to be smarter. It shouldn\u0027t just connect the targets. It needs to effectively *merge* the two `JoinPoint`s or pass connections through.\n\n**Revised Rewrite Rule (More Sophisticated):**\n\nLet\u0027s rethink the `joinPoint-Linker` rule. When `J1` and `J2` interact via `link`, we want to essentially eliminate `J2` and connect `J1`\u0027s *other* link (if any) to `J2`\u0027s *other* link, while also connecting their targets. This feels more like pointer manipulation than a simple rewrite.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Central \"Bus\" Agent**\n\nMaybe a chain isn\u0027t right.

Create a temporary `Connector` agent holding references (port keys) to all target ports.\n2.  Use another temporary agent (`Initiator`) to trigger an interaction with the `Connector`.\n3.  Define an `ActionRule` for `Initiator \u003c-\u003e Connector`.\n4.  This rule\u0027s `action` function reads the target port keys from the `Connector`\u0027s value.\n5.  It retrieves the actual `IBoundPort` instances using `getPortInstance`.\n6.  It calculates and returns all the necessary `IConnection` objects to connect the target ports in the desired pattern (e.g., a clique).\n7.  The rule consumes the temporary `Initiator` and `Connector` agents.\n\nThis leverages the power of the imperative `ActionRule` to perform the necessary lookups and connection creation logic dynamically at runtime, which is better suited for tasks involving an arbitrary number of participants like `multiConnect`. The `RewriteRule` is best reserved for fixed, predetermined structural replacements.",
