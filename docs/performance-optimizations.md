# Performance Optimizations in Annette

This document explains the performance optimization features in Annette, which significantly improve the efficiency of interaction net processing for large networks.

## Overview

Annette includes several advanced performance optimizations:

1. **Rule Indexing**: Efficiently match rules to connections
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Only process connections that might be affected by changes
3. **Structural Sharing**: Efficiently handle immutable data structures
4. **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks with automatic pruning and garbage collection
5. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple CPU cores for rule matching and application

## Rule Indexing

Rule indexing dramatically speeds up rule matching by pre-computing which rules can match which agent-port combinations:

```typescript
import { createOptimizedNetwork, RuleIndex } from 'annette';

// Method 1: Create an optimized network with rule indexing enabled
const network = createOptimizedNetwork(Core.createNetwork('indexed-example'), {
  enableRuleIndexing: true
});

// Method 2: Create and use a rule index manually
const ruleIndex = new RuleIndex();

// Add rules to the index
for (const rule of network.rules) {
  ruleIndex.addRule(rule);
}

// Find applicable rules for a connection
const rules = ruleIndex.findRules(agent1, port1, agent2, port2);
```

### How Rule Indexing Works

The `RuleIndex` class maintains several indexes:

1. **Agent Type Index**: Maps agent types to applicable rules
2. **Port Name Index**: Maps port names to applicable rules
3. **Pattern Index**: Maps specific agent-port patterns to rules
4. **Rule Cache**: Caches exact matches for specific agent-port combinations

This multi-tiered indexing approach enables the system to quickly find applicable rules without having to check every rule for every connection.

## Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation optimizes network reduction by only processing connections that might be affected by changes:

```typescript
import { createOptimizedNetwork, ConnectionTracker } from 'annette';

// Create an optimized network with lazy evaluation
const network = createOptimizedNetwork(Core.createNetwork('lazy-example'), {
  enableLazyEvaluation: true
});

// When creating a connection or modifying an agent, only connections
// involving that agent will be evaluated in the next reduction step
network.connectPorts(agent1.ports.main, agent2.ports.main);
agent1.value.property = 'changed';

// Only connections involving agent1 will be evaluated
network.reduce();
```

### How Lazy Evaluation Works

The `ConnectionTracker` class:

1. Tracks all connections in the network
2. Maintains a set of "dirty" connections that need evaluation
3. When an agent is modified, marks all its connections as dirty
4. During reduction, only processes dirty connections
5. After a connection is processed, marks it as clean

This approach dramatically reduces the number of rule matching operations needed for large networks.

## Structural Sharing

Structural sharing enables efficient immutable updates to agent values:

```typescript
import { StructuralSharing } from 'annette';

// Update an object immutably with structural sharing
const newValue = StructuralSharing.update(agent.value, draft => {
  draft.counter = 42;
  draft.items.push('new item');
  draft.nested.property = 'changed';
});

// Only the changed branches are copied; unchanged parts are shared
agent.value = newValue;

// Also works with arrays
const newArray = StructuralSharing.updateArray(agent.value.items, draft => {
  draft.push('another item');
  draft[0] = 'changed first item';
});

// Merge objects immutably
const merged = StructuralSharing.merge(agent.value, {
  counter: 50,
  newProperty: 'added'
});
```

### How Structural Sharing Works

Annette uses the [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) library to implement structural sharing:

1. Creates a proxy around the original object
2. Tracks all mutations made to the proxy
3. Only creates new objects for the parts of the tree that changed
4. Returns a new immutable object with structural sharing

This approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves performance for complex data structures.

## Memory Management

Memory management prevents memory leaks and reduces memory consumption:

```typescript
import { createOptimizedNetwork, MemoryManager } from 'annette';

// Create an optimized network with memory management
const network = createOptimizedNetwork(Core.createNetwork('memory-example'), {
  enableMemoryManagement: true,
  memoryConfig: {
    maxHistorySize: 1000,       // Maximum history entries to keep
    maxHistoryAge: 3600000,     // Maximum age in milliseconds (1 hour)
    enableGarbageCollection: true,
    gcInterval: 60000,          // Run GC every minute
    enableObjectPooling: true,
    maxPoolSize: 100            // Maximum objects in each pool
  }
});

// Memory management happens automatically during network operations

// Manual memory management:
const memoryManager = new MemoryManager(network, {
  maxHistorySize: 500,
  maxHistoryAge: 1800000  // 30 minutes
});

// Prune history manually
const prunedHistory = memoryManager.pruneHistory(networkHistory);

// Run garbage collection manually
const removedCount = memoryManager.garbageCollect();

// Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
const tempObject = memoryManager.getPooledObject('connection', () => {
  // Factory function to create a new object if none in pool
  return { /* new object */ };
});

// Return object to pool when done
memoryManager.returnObjectToPool('connection', tempObject);
```

### How Memory Management Works

The `MemoryManager` class provides:

1. **History Pruning**: Automatically removes old history entries based on age and count
2. **Garbage Collection**: Identifies and removes unreachable agents
3. **Object Pooling**: Reuses frequently created/destroyed objects

The garbage collector works by:
1. Identifying "root" agents (those with no incoming connections)
2. Traversing the connection graph to mark all reachable agents
3. Removing any agents that aren't marked as reachable

## Parallel Processing

Parallel processing utilizes multiple CPU cores for rule matching and application:

```typescript
import { createOptimizedNetwork, ParallelProcessing } from 'annette';

// Create an optimized network with parallel processing
const network = createOptimizedNetwork(Core.createNetwork('parallel-example'), {
  enableParallelProcessing: true,
  workerScriptUrl: '/workers/annette-worker.js',
  numWorkers: 4  // Number of parallel workers (defaults to CPU core count)
});

// Parallel processing happens automatically during network operations

// Manual parallel processing:
const parallelProcessor = new ParallelProcessing(
  '/workers/annette-worker.js',
  navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 4
);

// Execute a task in parallel
const result = await parallelProcessor.executeTask({
  type: 'matchRules',
  data: { /* task data */ }
});
```

### How Parallel Processing Works

The `ParallelProcessing` class:

1. Creates a pool of Web Workers
2. Distributes tasks among the workers
3. Collects and combines results
4. Handles worker management and error handling

Tasks that benefit from parallelization include:
- Rule matching across many connections
- Independent rule applications
- Large network transformations

## Combining Optimizations

For maximum performance, you can combine all optimizations:

```typescript
import { createOptimizedNetwork } from 'annette';

// Create a fully optimized network
const network = createOptimizedNetwork(Core.createNetwork('optimized-example'), {
  // Enable all optimizations
  enableRuleIndexing: true,
  enableLazyEvaluation: true,
  enableStructuralSharing: true,
  enableMemoryManagement: true,
  enableParallelProcessing: true,
  
  // Configure memory management
  memoryConfig: {
    maxHistorySize: 1000,
    maxHistoryAge: 3600000,
    enableGarbageCollection: true,
    gcInterval: 60000,
    enableObjectPooling: true,
    maxPoolSize: 100
  },
  
  // Configure parallel processing
  workerScriptUrl: '/workers/annette-worker.js',
  numWorkers: navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 4
});

// All optimizations work together automatically
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the basic optimizations and add more as needed
2. **Measure First**: Profile your application to identify actual bottlenecks
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Some optimizations increase memory usage
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure optimizations don't change behavior
5. **Use the Right Tools**: For simple networks, optimizations may not be necessary

## Conclusion
